Security Fix(es):

  * An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor
designs have implemented speculative execution of Load &amp  Store instructions
(a commonly used performance optimization). It relies on the presence of a
precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as
the fact that memory read from address to which a recent memory write has
occurred may see an older value and subsequently cause an update into the
microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions
that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker
could use this flaw to read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache
side-channel attacks. (CVE-2018-3639)

Note: This is the qemu-kvm side of the CVE-2018-3639 mitigation that
includes support for guests running on hosts with AMD processors.

Red Hat would like to thank Ken Johnson (Microsoft Security Response
Center) and Jann Horn (Google Project Zero) for reporting this issue.");
