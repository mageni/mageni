Security Fix(es):

  * An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor
designs have implemented speculative execution of Load &amp  Store instructions
(a commonly used performance optimization). It relies on the presence of a
precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as
the fact that memory read from address to which a recent memory write has
occurred may see an older value and subsequently cause an update into the
microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions
that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker
could use this flaw to read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache
side-channel attacks. (CVE-2018-3639)

Note: This issue is present in hardware and cannot be fully fixed via
software update. The updated kernel packages provide software side of the
mitigation for this hardware issue. To be fully functional, up-to-date CPU
microcode applied on the system is required. Please refer to References
section for further information about this issue, CPU microcode
requirements and the potential performance impact.

In this update mitigations for x86 (both 32 and 64 bit) architecture are
provided.

Red Hat would like to thank Ken Johnson (Microsoft Security Response
Center) and Jann Horn (Google Project Zero) for reporting this issue.

Bug Fix(es):

  * Previously, an erroneous code in the x86 kexec system call path caused a
memory corruption. As a consequence, the system became unresponsive with
the following kernel stack trace:

'WARNING: CPU: 13 PID: 36409 at lib/list_debug.c:59
__list_del_entry+0xa1/0xd0 list_del corruption. prev- next should be
ffffdd03fddeeca0, but was (null)'

This update ensures that the code does not corrupt memory. As a result, the
operating system no longer hangs. (BZ#1573176)");
