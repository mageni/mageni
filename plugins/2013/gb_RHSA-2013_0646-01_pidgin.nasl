  A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the Pidgin MXit protocol
  plug-in. A malicious server or a remote attacker could use this flaw to
  crash Pidgin by sending a specially-crafted HTTP request. (CVE-2013-0272)

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the Pidgin Sametime protocol plug-in.
  A malicious server or a remote attacker could use this flaw to crash Pidgin
  by sending a specially-crafted username. (CVE-2013-0273)

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Pidgin processed certain UPnP
  responses. A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted UPnP response
  that, when processed, would crash Pidgin. (CVE-2013-0274)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Pidgin project for reporting the above
  issues. Upstream acknowledges Daniel Atallah as the original reporter of
  CVE-2013-0272.

  All Pidgin users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to resolve these issues. Pidgin must be restarted for
  this update to take effect.");
