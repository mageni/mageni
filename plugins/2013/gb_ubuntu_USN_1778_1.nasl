  Xen virtualizeation. In the 32-bit Xen paravirt platform an unprivileged
  guest OS user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash
  the system) or gain guest OS privilege. (CVE-2013-0228)

  A flaw was reported in the permission checks done by the Linux kernel for
  /dev/cpu/*/msr. A local root user with all capabilities dropped could
  exploit this flaw to execute code with full root capabilities.
  (CVE-2013-0268)

  A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's vhost driver used to accelerate
  guest networking in KVM based virtual machines. A privileged guest user
  could exploit this flaw to crash the host system. (CVE-2013-0311)

  An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth stack
  when HIDP (Human Interface Device Protocol) support is enabled. A local
  unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause an information leak from
  the kernel. (CVE-2013-0349)

  A flaw was discovered on the Linux kernel's VFAT filesystem driver when a
  disk is mounted with the utf8 option (this is the default on Ubuntu). On a
  system where disks/images can be auto-mounted or a FAT filesystem is
  mounted an unprivileged user can exploit the flaw to gain root privileges.
