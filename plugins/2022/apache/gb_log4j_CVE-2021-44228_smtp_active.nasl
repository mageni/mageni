  CVE-2021-44228: Apache Log4j2 JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do
  not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can
  control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers
  when message lookup substitution is enabled.

  Notes:

  - This vulnerability is dubbed 'Log4Shell'

  - After the release of version 2.15.0 it was determined that an attack vector for remote code
  execution (RCE) still exists in specific configurations. The solution of this VT has been updated
  with info for full protection against all current known attack vectors.

  CVE-2021-45046: Denial of Service (DoS) and a possible remote code execution (RCE) in certain
  non-default configurations.");
