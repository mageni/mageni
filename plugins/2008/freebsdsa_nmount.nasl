in the base system to graft a file system object on to the file system
tree to a given mount point.  It is possible to allow unprivileged
users to utililize these system calls by setting the vfs.usermount
sysctl(8) variable.

Various user defined input such as mount points, devices, and mount
options are prepared and passed as arguments to nmount(2) into the
kernel.  Under certain error conditions, user defined data will be
copied into a stack allocated buffer stored in the kernel without
sufficient bounds checking.";
