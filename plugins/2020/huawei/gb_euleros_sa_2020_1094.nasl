An issue was discovered in GNU libiberty, as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.32. It is a stack consumption issue in d_count_templates_scopes in cp-demangle.c after many recursive calls.(CVE-2019-9071)

An issue was discovered in GNU libiberty, as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.32. simple_object_elf_match in simple-object-elf.c does not check for a zero shstrndx value, leading to an integer overflow and resultant heap-based buffer overflow.(CVE-2019-14250)

An issue was discovered in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.32. It is an attempted excessive memory allocation in elf_read_notes in elf.c.(CVE-2019-9076)

An issue was discovered in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.32. It is an out-of-bounds read leading to a SEGV in bfd_getl32 in libbfd.c, when called from pex64_get_runtime_function in pei-x86_64.c.(CVE-2019-9074)

GNU gdb All versions is affected by: Buffer Overflow - Out of bound memory access. The impact is: Deny of Service, Memory Disclosure, and Possible Code Execution. The component is: The main gdb module. The attack vector is: Open an ELF for debugging. The fixed version is: Not fixed yet.(CVE-2019-1010180)

The demangle_template function in cplus-dem.c in GNU libiberty, as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.31.1, has a memory leak via a crafted string, leading to a denial of service (memory consumption), as demonstrated by cxxfilt, a related issue to CVE-2018-12698.(CVE-2018-20657)

The get_count function in cplus-dem.c in GNU libiberty, as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.31, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (malloc called with the result of an integer-overflowing calculation) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted string, as demonstrated by c++filt.(CVE-2018-18483)");
