Linux kernel did not properly check for error conditions in some
situations. An attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of
service (system crash). (CVE-2019-16089)

It was discovered that the kernel->user space relay implementation in the
Linux kernel did not properly check return values in some situations. A
local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system
crash). (CVE-2019-19462)

Chuhong Yuan discovered that go7007 USB audio device driver in the Linux
kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some failure conditions. A
physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-20810)

Jason A. Donenfeld discovered that the ACPI implementation in the Linux
kernel did not properly restrict loading SSDT code from an EFI variable. A
privileged attacker could use this to bypass Secure Boot lockdown
restrictions and execute arbitrary code in the kernel. (CVE-2019-20908)

It was discovered that the elf handling code in the Linux kernel did not
initialize memory before using it in certain situations. A local attacker
could use this to possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory).
(CVE-2020-10732)

Fan Yang discovered that the mremap implementation in the Linux kernel did
not properly handle DAX Huge Pages. A local attacker with access to DAX
storage could use this to gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2020-10757)

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not correctly apply Speculative
Store Bypass Disable (SSBD) mitigations in certain situations. A local
attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.
(CVE-2020-10766)

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not correctly apply Indirect
Branch Predictor Barrier (IBPB) mitigations in certain situations. A local
attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.
(CVE-2020-10767)

It was discovered that the Linux kernel could incorrectly enable indirect
branch speculation after it has been disabled for a process via a prctl()
call. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive
information. (CVE-2020-10768)

Mauricio Faria de Oliveira discovered that the aufs implementation in the
Linux kernel improperly managed inode reference counts in the
vfsub_dentry_open() method. A local attacker could use this vulnerability
to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2020-11935)

It was discovered that the Virtual Terminal keyboard driver in the Linux
kernel contained an integer overflow. A local attacker could possibly use
this to  ...
