cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive

It was discovered that the vhost net driver in the Linux kernel contained a
stack buffer overflow. A local attacker with the ability to perform ioctl()
calls on /dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a denial of service (system
crash). (CVE-2020-10942)

It was discovered that the virtual terminal implementation in the Linux
kernel contained a race condition. A local attacker could possibly use this
to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive

Shijie Luo discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux
kernel did not properly check for a too-large journal size. An attacker
could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted,
could cause a denial of service (soft lockup). (CVE-2020-8992)
