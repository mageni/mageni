We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

It was discovered that the btrfs implementation in the Linux kernel did not
properly detect that a block was marked dirty in some situations. An
attacker could use this to specially craft a file system image that, when
unmounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-19377)

Tristan Madani discovered that the file locking implementation in the Linux
kernel contained a race condition. A local attacker could possibly use this
to cause a denial of service or expose sensitive information.
(CVE-2019-19769)

It was discovered that the Serial CAN interface driver in the Linux kernel
did not properly initialize data. A local attacker could use this to expose
sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2020-11494)

It was discovered that the linux kernel did not properly validate certain
mount options to the tmpfs virtual memory file system. A local attacker
with the ability to specify mount options could use this to cause a denial
of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-11565)

It was discovered that the OV51x USB Camera device driver in the Linux
kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).
(CVE-2020-11608)

It was discovered that the STV06XX USB Camera device driver in the Linux
kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).
(CVE-2020-11609)

It was discovered that the Xirlink C-It USB Camera device driver in the
Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically
proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system
crash). (CVE-2020-11668)

It was discovered that the block layer in the Linux kernel contained a race
condition leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could
possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-12657)");
