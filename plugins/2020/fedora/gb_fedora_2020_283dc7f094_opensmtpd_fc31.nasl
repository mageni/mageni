by RFC 5321, with some additional standard extensions. It allows ordinary
machines to exchange e-mails with other systems speaking the SMTP protocol.
Started out of dissatisfaction with other implementations, OpenSMTPD nowadays
is a fairly complete SMTP implementation. OpenSMTPD is primarily developed
by Gilles Chehade, Eric Faurot and Charles Longeau, with contributions from
various OpenBSD hackers. OpenSMTPD is part of the OpenBSD Project.
The software is freely usable and re-usable by everyone under an ISC license.

This package uses standard 'alternatives' mechanism, you may call
'/usr/sbin/alternatives --set mta /usr/sbin/sendmail.opensmtpd'
if you want to switch to OpenSMTPD MTA immediately after install, and
'/usr/sbin/alternatives --set mta /usr/sbin/sendmail.sendmail' to revert
back to Sendmail as a default mail daemon.");
