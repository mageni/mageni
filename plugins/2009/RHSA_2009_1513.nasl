tag_summary = "The remote host is missing updates announced in
advisory RHSA-2009:1513.

The Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) provides a portable printing layer
for UNIX operating systems. The CUPS pdftops filter converts Portable
Document Format (PDF) files to PostScript.

Two integer overflow flaws were found in the CUPS pdftops filter. An
attacker could create a malicious PDF file that would cause pdftops to
crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code as the lp user if the file
was printed. (CVE-2009-3608, CVE-2009-3609)

Red Hat would like to thank Chris Rohlf for reporting the CVE-2009-3608
issue.

Users of cups are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to correct these issues. After installing the
update, the cupsd daemon will be restarted automatically.";

Red Hat Network.  To use Red Hat Network, launch the Red
