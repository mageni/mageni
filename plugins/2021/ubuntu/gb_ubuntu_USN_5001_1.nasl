protocol of the Linux kernel leading to multiple use-after-free
vulnerabilities. A local attacker could use this issue to execute arbitrary
code. (CVE-2021-3609)

Mathy Vanhoef discovered Linux kernels WiFi implementation did
not properly clear received fragments from memory in some situations. A
physically proximate attacker could possibly use this issue to inject
packets or expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-24586)

Mathy Vanhoef discovered Linux kernels WiFi implementation
incorrectly handled encrypted fragments. A physically proximate attacker
could possibly use this issue to decrypt fragments. (CVE-2020-24587)

Mathy Vanhoef discovered Linux kernels WiFi implementation
incorrectly handled certain malformed frames. If a user were tricked into
connecting to a malicious server, a physically proximate attacker could use
this issue to inject packets. (CVE-2020-24588)

Mathy Vanhoef discovered Linux kernels WiFi implementation
incorrectly handled EAPOL frames from unauthenticated senders. A physically
proximate attacker could inject malicious packets to cause a denial of
service (system crash). (CVE-2020-26139)

Mathy Vanhoef discovered Linux kernels WiFi implementation did
not properly verify certain fragmented frames. A physically proximate
attacker could possibly use this issue to inject or decrypt packets.

Mathy Vanhoef discovered in the Linux kernels WiFi implementation
leading to accepting plaintext fragments. A physically proximate attacker
could use this issue to inject packets. (CVE-2020-26145)

Mathy Vanhoef discovered the Linux kernels WiFi implementation
leading to reassembling mixed encrypted and plaintext fragments. A
physically proximate attacker could possibly use this issue to inject
packets or exfiltrate selected fragments. (CVE-2020-26147)
