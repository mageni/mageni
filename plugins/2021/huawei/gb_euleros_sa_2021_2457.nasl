A flaw was found in libcurl in the way libcurl handles previously used connections without accounting for 'issuer cert' and comparing the involved paths case-insensitively. This flaw allows libcurl to use the wrong connection. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.(CVE-2021-22924)

A has been found in curl. The fix for CVE-2021-22898 doesn't remedy the vulnerability. A flaw in the option parser for sending NEW_ENV variables libcurl can pass uninitialized data from a stack-based buffer to the server. This issue leads to potentially revealing sensitive internal information to the server using a clear-text network protocol. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.(CVE-2021-22925)");
