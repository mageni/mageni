A flaw was found in binutils. An attacker who is able to submit a crafted input file to be processed by the objdump program could cause a null pointer dereference. The greatest threat from this flaw is to application availability.(CVE-2020-35495)

There's a flaw in the BFD library of binutils. An attacker who supplies a crafted file to an application linked with BFD, and using the DWARF functionality, could cause an impact to system availability by way of excessive memory consumption.(CVE-2021-3487)

An Out of Bounds flaw was found in GNU binutils objdump utility. An attacker could use this flaw and pass a large section to avr_elf32_load_records_from_section() probably resulting in a crash or in some cases memory corruption. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to integrity as well as system availability.(CVE-2021-3549)");
