access based on the objectClass, then that user has write access to that
object.

Additionally, if a user has write access to any attribute on the object,
they may have access to write to all attributes.

An important mitigation is that anonymous access is totally disabled by
default.  The second important mitigation is that normal users are
typically only given the problematic per-objectClass right via the
'pre-windows 2000 compatible access' group, and Samba 4.0.0 incorrectly
does not make 'authenticated users' part of this group.");
