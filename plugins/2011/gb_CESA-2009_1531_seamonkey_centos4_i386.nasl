  A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey creates temporary file names for
  downloaded files. If a local attacker knows the name of a file SeaMonkey is
  going to download, they can replace the contents of that file with
  arbitrary contents. (CVE-2009-3274)

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the SeaMonkey string to
  floating point conversion routines. A web page containing malicious
  JavaScript could crash SeaMonkey or, potentially, execute arbitrary code
  with the privileges of the user running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2009-1563)

  A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handles text selection. A malicious
  website may be able to read highlighted text in a different domain (e.g.
  another website the user is viewing), bypassing the same-origin policy.
  (CVE-2009-3375)

  A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey displays a right-to-left override
  character when downloading a file. In these cases, the name displayed in
  the title bar differs from the name displayed in the dialog body. An
  attacker could use this flaw to trick a user into downloading a file that
  has a file name or extension that differs from what the user expected.
  (CVE-2009-3376)

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  SeaMonkey. (CVE-2009-3380)

  All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct
  these issues. After installing the update, SeaMonkey must be restarted for
  the changes to take effect.");
