  A denial of service flaw was found in the Apache mod_proxy module when it
  was used as a reverse proxy. A remote attacker could use this flaw to force
  a proxy process to consume large amounts of CPU time. (CVE-2009-1890)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the Apache mod_deflate module. This
  module continued to compress large files until compression was complete,
  even if the network connection that requested the content was closed before
  compression completed. This would cause mod_deflate to consume large
  amounts of CPU if mod_deflate was enabled for a large file. (CVE-2009-1891)

  backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the updated
