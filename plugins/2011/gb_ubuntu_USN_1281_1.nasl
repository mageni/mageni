  If KSM was being used, a local attacker could exploit this to crash the
  system, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2183)

  It was discovered that an mmap() call with the MAP_PRIVATE flag on
  '/dev/zero' was incorrectly handled. A local attacker could exploit this to
  crash the system, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2479)

  Vasily Averin discovered that the NFS Lock Manager (NLM) incorrectly
  handled unlock requests. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a
  denial of service. (CVE-2011-2491)

  Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that taskstats did not enforce access
  restrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to read certain
  information, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-2494)

  Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that /proc/PID/io did not enforce access
  restrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to read certain
  information, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-2495)

  Robert Swiecki discovered that mapping extensions were incorrectly handled.
  A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a
  denial of service. (CVE-2011-2496)

  It was discovered that the wireless stack incorrectly verified SSID
  lengths. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service
  or gain root privileges. (CVE-2011-2517)

  Christian Ohm discovered that the perf command looks for configuration
  files in the current directory. If a privileged user were tricked into
  running perf in a directory containing a malicious configuration file, an
  attacker could run arbitrary commands and possibly gain privileges.
  (CVE-2011-2905)

  Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the Comedi driver did not correctly clear
  memory. A local attacker could exploit this to read kernel stack memory,
  leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-2909)

  Yogesh Sharma discovered that CIFS did not correctly handle UNCs that had
  no prefixpaths. A local attacker with access to a CIFS partition could
  exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.
