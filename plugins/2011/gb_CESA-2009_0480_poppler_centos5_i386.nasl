  Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in poppler. An attacker could
  create a malicious PDF file that would cause applications that use poppler
  (such as Evince) to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code when
  opened. (CVE-2009-0147, CVE-2009-1179, CVE-2009-1187, CVE-2009-1188)

  Multiple buffer overflow flaws were found in poppler's JBIG2 decoder. An
  attacker could create a malicious PDF file that would cause applications
  that use poppler (such as Evince) to crash or, potentially, execute
  arbitrary code when opened. (CVE-2009-0146, CVE-2009-1182)

  Multiple flaws were found in poppler's JBIG2 decoder that could lead to the
  freeing of arbitrary memory. An attacker could create a malicious PDF file
  that would cause applications that use poppler (such as Evince) to crash
  or, potentially, execute arbitrary code when opened. (CVE-2009-0166,
  CVE-2009-1180)

  Multiple input validation flaws were found in poppler's JBIG2 decoder. An
  attacker could create a malicious PDF file that would cause applications
  that use poppler (such as Evince) to crash or, potentially, execute
  arbitrary code when opened. (CVE-2009-0800)
