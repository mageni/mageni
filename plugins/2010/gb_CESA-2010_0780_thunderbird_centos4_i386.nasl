tag_insight = "Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed HTML mail content.
  An HTML mail message containing malicious content could cause Thunderbird
  to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
  user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2010-3176, CVE-2010-3180)

  Note: JavaScript support is disabled by default in Thunderbird. The above
  issues are not exploitable unless JavaScript is enabled.

  A flaw was found in the script that launches Thunderbird. The
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable was appending a &quot;.&quot; character, which could allow a
  local attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a different
  user running Thunderbird, if that user ran Thunderbird from within an
  attacker-controlled directory. (CVE-2010-3182)

  All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
  resolves these issues. All running instances of Thunderbird must be
  restarted for the update to take effect.";
