tag_insight = "pseudofs offers an abstract API for pseudo file systems which is utilized by
procfs(5) and linprocfs(5).  It provides generic file system services such
as ACLs, extended attributes which interface with VFS and which are otherwise
onerous to implement.  This enables pseudo file system authors to add this
functionality to their file systems with minimal effort.

The pfs_getextattr(9) function, used by pseudofs for handling extended
attributes, attempts to unlock a mutex which was not previously locked.";
