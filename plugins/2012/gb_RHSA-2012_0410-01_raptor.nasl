  An XML External Entity expansion flaw was found in the way Raptor processed
  RDF files. If an application linked against Raptor were to open a
  specially-crafted RDF file, it could possibly allow a remote attacker to
  obtain a copy of an arbitrary local file that the user running the
  application had access to. A bug in the way Raptor handled external
  entities could cause that application to crash or, possibly, execute
  arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.
  (CVE-2012-0037)

  Red Hat would like to thank Timothy D. Morgan of VSR for reporting this
  issue.

  All Raptor users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. All running applications
  linked against Raptor must be restarted for this update to take effect.");
