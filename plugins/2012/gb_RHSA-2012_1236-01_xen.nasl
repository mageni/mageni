  A flaw was found in the way QEMU handled VT100 terminal escape sequences
  when emulating certain character devices. A guest user with privileges to
  write to a character device that is emulated on the host using a virtual
  console back-end could use this flaw to crash the qemu process on the
  host or, possibly, escalate their privileges on the host. (CVE-2012-3515)

  This flaw did not affect the default use of the Xen hypervisor
  implementation in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. This problem only affected
  fully-virtualized guests that have a serial or parallel device that uses a
  virtual console (vc) back-end. By default, the virtual console back-end is
  not used for such devices. Only guests explicitly configured to use them
  in this way were affected.

  Red Hat would like to thank the Xen project for reporting this issue.

  All users of xen are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct this issue. After installing the updated packages, all
  fully-virtualized guests must be restarted for this update to take effect.");
