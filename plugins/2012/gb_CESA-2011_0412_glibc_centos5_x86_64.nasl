  The fix for CVE-2010-3847 introduced a regression in the way the dynamic
  loader expanded the $ORIGIN dynamic string token specified in the RPATH and
  RUNPATH entries in the ELF library header. A local attacker could use this
  flaw to escalate their privileges via a setuid or setgid program using
  such a library. (CVE-2011-0536)

  It was discovered that the glibc addmntent() function did not sanitize its
  input properly. A local attacker could possibly use this flaw to inject
  malformed lines into /etc/mtab via certain setuid mount helpers, if the
  attacker were allowed to mount to an arbitrary directory under their
  control. (CVE-2010-0296)

  It was discovered that the glibc fnmatch() function did not properly
  restrict the use of alloca(). If the function was called on sufficiently
  large inputs, it could cause an application using fnmatch() to crash or,
  possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application.
  (CVE-2011-1071)

  It was discovered that the locale command did not produce properly escaped
  output as required by the POSIX specification. If an attacker were able to
  set the locale environment variables in the environment of a script that
  performed shell evaluation on the output of the locale command, and that
  script were run with different privileges than the attacker's, it could
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the script. (CVE-2011-1095)

  All users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues.");
