zip archive.

A buffer overflow was found in the way unzip uncompressed certain extra
fields of a file. A specially crafted Zip archive could cause unzip to
crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code when the archive was tested with
unzip's '-t' option. (CVE-2014-9636)

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way unzip computed the CRC32
checksum of certain extra fields of a file. A specially crafted Zip archive
could cause unzip to crash when the archive was tested with unzip's '-t'
option. (CVE-2014-8139)

An integer underflow flaw, leading to a buffer overflow, was found in the
way unzip uncompressed certain extra fields of a file. A specially crafted
Zip archive could cause unzip to crash when the archive was tested with
unzip's '-t' option. (CVE-2014-8140)

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way unzip handled Zip64 files.
A specially crafted Zip archive could possibly cause unzip to crash when
the archive was uncompressed. (CVE-2014-8141)

Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting the CVE-2014-8139,
CVE-2014-8140, and CVE-2014-8141 issues. oCERT acknowledges Michele
Spagnuolo of the Google Security Team as the original reporter of
