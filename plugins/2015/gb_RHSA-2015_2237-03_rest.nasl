easier to access web services that claim to be RESTful. A RESTful service should
have URLs that represent remote objects, which methods can then be called on.

It was found that the OAuth implementation in librest, a helper library for
RESTful services, incorrectly truncated the pointer returned by the
rest_proxy_call_get_url call. An attacker could use this flaw to crash an
application using the librest library. (CVE-2015-2675)

All users of rest are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing the
update, all applications using librest must be restarted for the update to
take effect.");
