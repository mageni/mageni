server for web clients, supporting FTP, Gopher, and HTTP data objects.

It was found that Squid configured with client-first SSL-bump did not
correctly validate X.509 server certificate host name fields. A
man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof a Squid server
using a specially crafted X.509 certificate. (CVE-2015-3455)

This update fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, the squid process did not handle file descriptors correctly
when receiving Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) requests. As a
consequence, the process gradually accumulated open file descriptors. This
bug has been fixed and squid now handles SNMP requests correctly, closing
file descriptors when necessary. (BZ#1198778)

  * Under high system load, the squid process sometimes terminated
unexpectedly with a segmentation fault during reboot. This update provides
better memory handling during reboot, thus fixing this bug. (BZ#1225640)

Users of squid are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which fix
these bugs. After installing this update, the squid service will be
restarted automatically.");
