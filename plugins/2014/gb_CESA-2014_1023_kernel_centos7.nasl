  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"The kernel packages contain the Linux
kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

  * It was found that Linux kernel's ptrace subsystem did not properly
sanitize the address-space-control bits when the program-status word (PSW)
was being set. On IBM S/390 systems, a local, unprivileged user could use
this flaw to set address-space-control bits to the kernel space, and thus
gain read and write access to kernel memory. (CVE-2014-3534, Important)

  * It was found that the permission checks performed by the Linux kernel
when a netlink message was received were not sufficient. A local,
unprivileged user could potentially bypass these restrictions by passing a
netlink socket as stdout or stderr to a more privileged process and
altering the output of this process. (CVE-2014-0181, Moderate)

  * It was found that a remote attacker could use a race condition flaw in
the ath_tx_aggr_sleep() function to crash the system by creating large
network traffic on the system's Atheros 9k wireless network adapter.
(CVE-2014-2672, Moderate)

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel performed forking inside of
a transaction. A local, unprivileged user on a PowerPC system that supports
transactional memory could use this flaw to crash the system.
(CVE-2014-2673, Moderate)

  * A race condition flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's mac80211
subsystem implementation handled synchronization between TX and STA wake-up
code paths. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the system.
(CVE-2014-2706, Moderate)

  * An integer underflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Stream
Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation processed certain
COOKIE_ECHO packets. By sending a specially crafted SCTP packet, a remote
attacker could use this flaw to prevent legitimate connections to a
particular SCTP server socket to be made. (CVE-2014-4667, Moderate)

Red Hat would like to thank Martin Schwidefsky of IBM for reporting
CVE-2014-3534, Andy Lutomirski for reporting CVE-2014-0181, and Gopal Reddy
Kodudula of Nokia Siemens Networks for reporting CVE-2014-4667.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Due to a NULL pointer dereference bug in the IPIP and SIT tunneling code,
a kernel panic could be triggered when using IPIP or SIT tunnels with
IPsec. This update restructures the related code to avoid a NULL pointer
dereference and the kernel no longer panics when using IPIP or SIT tunnels
with IPsec. (BZ#1114957)

  * Previously, an IBM POWER8 system could terminate unexpectedly when the
kernel received an IRQ while handling a transactional memory re-checkpoint
critical section. This update ensures that  ...
