  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel virtual machine's
(kvm) validation of interrupt requests (irq). A guest OS user could exploit this
flaw to cause a denial of service (host OS crash). (CVE-2014-0155)

Andy Lutomirski discovered a flaw in the authorization of netlink socket
operations when a socket is passed to a process of more privilege. A local
user could exploit this flaw to bypass access restrictions by having a
privileged executable do something it was not intended to do.
(CVE-2014-0181)

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernels
aio_read_events_ring function. A local user could exploit this flaw to
obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.
(CVE-2014-0206)

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's implementation of user
namespaces with respect to inode permissions. A local user could exploit
this flaw by creating a user namespace to gain administrative privileges.
(CVE-2014-4014)

An information leak was discovered in the rd_mcp backend of the iSCSI
target subsystem in the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw
to obtain sensitive information from ramdisk_mcp memory by leveraging
access to a SCSI initiator. (CVE-2014-4027)

Sasha Levin reported an issue with the Linux kernel's shared memory
subsystem when used with range notifications and hole punching. A local
user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2014-4171)

Toralf F&#246 rster reported an error in the Linux kernels syscall auditing on
32 bit x86 platforms. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a
denial of service (OOPS and system crash). (CVE-2014-4508)

An information leak was discovered in the control implementation of the
Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem in the Linux kernel. A
local user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from
kernel memory. (CVE-2014-4652)

A use-after-free flaw was discovered in the Advanced Linux Sound
Architecture (ALSA) control implementation of the Linux kernel. A local
user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash).
(CVE-2014-4653)

A authorization bug was discovered with the snd_ctl_elem_add function of
the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) in the Linux kernel. A local
user could exploit his bug to cause a denial of service (remove kernel
controls). (CVE-2014-4654)

A flaw discovered in how the snd_ctl_elem function of the Advanced Linux
Sound Architecture (ALSA) handled a reference count. A local user could
exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (integer overflow and limit
bypass). (CVE-2014-4655)

An integer overflow flaw was discovered  ...
