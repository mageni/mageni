  script_tag(name:"affected", value:"samba on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (v. 5 server)");
  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Samba is an open-source implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB) or
Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol, which allows PC-compatible
machines to share files, printers, and other information.

It was discovered that the Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT) did not
protect against being opened in a web page frame. A remote attacker could
possibly use this flaw to conduct a clickjacking attack against SWAT users
or users with an active SWAT session. (CVE-2013-0213)

A flaw was found in the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection
mechanism implemented in SWAT. An attacker with the knowledge of a victim's
password could use this flaw to bypass CSRF protections and conduct a CSRF
attack against the victim SWAT user. (CVE-2013-0214)

An integer overflow flaw was found in the way Samba handled an Extended
Attribute (EA) list provided by a client. A malicious client could send a
specially crafted EA list that triggered an overflow, causing the server to
loop and reprocess the list using an excessive amount of memory.
(CVE-2013-4124)

Note: This issue did not affect the default configuration of the Samba
server.

Red Hat would like to thank the Samba project for reporting CVE-2013-0213
and CVE-2013-0214. Upstream acknowledges Jann Horn as the original reporter
of CVE-2013-0213 and CVE-2013-0214.

contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing this
