  <summary>Common Product Enumeration CSV table.</summary>
  <description>
CPE stands for Common Product Enumeration.  It is a structured naming scheme for
information technology systems, platforms, and packages.  In other words: CPE
provides a unique identifier for virtually any software product that is known for
a vulnerability.

The CPE dictionary is maintained by MITRE and NIST.  MITRE also maintains CVE
(Common Vulnerability Enumeration) and other relevant security standards.

The report selects all CPE tables from the results and forms a single table
as a comma separated values file.
