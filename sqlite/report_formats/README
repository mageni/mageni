gvm/report_formats
==================

This directory contains a number of report formats that are not installed
by default.

They might be incomplete or in other ways in the works.

Running

. create_report_import

in a subdirectory will create a .xml import file for uploading it into
Greenbone Vulnerability Manager as a personal report format.

The script tries to create a signature for the report with your default
GnuPG signature key.  You can ignore this if you don't have one or don't
want this to be done.

This processing is implemented quite coarsely at the moment.  Eventually it
should be driven by a CMakeLists.txt
