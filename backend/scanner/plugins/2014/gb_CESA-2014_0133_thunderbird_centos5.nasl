Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed content.
Malicious content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird.
(CVE-2014-1477, CVE-2014-1482, CVE-2014-1486)

A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handled error messages related to
web workers. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass the same-origin
policy, which could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or could
potentially be used to gather authentication tokens and other data from
third-party websites. (CVE-2014-1487)

A flaw was found in the implementation of System Only Wrappers (SOW).
An attacker could use this flaw to crash Thunderbird. When combined with
other vulnerabilities, this flaw could have additional security
implications. (CVE-2014-1479)

It was found that the Thunderbird JavaScript engine incorrectly handled
window objects. A remote attacker could use this flaw to bypass certain
security checks and possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-1481)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Christian Holler, Terrence Cole, Jesse Ruderman, Gary
Kwong, Eric Rescorla, Jonathan Kew, Dan Gohman, Ryan VanderMeulen, Sotaro
Ikeda, Cody Crews, Fredrik 'Flonka' Lonnqvist, Arthur Gerkis, Masato
Kinugawa, and Boris Zbarsky as the original reporters of these issues.

Note: All of the above issues cannot be exploited by a specially crafted
HTML mail message as JavaScript is disabled by default for mail messages.
They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for example, when
viewing the full remote content of an RSS feed.

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Thunderbird 24.3.0. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section of this erratum.

All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains Thunderbird version 24.3.0, which corrects these issues.
After installing the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes
to take effect.");
