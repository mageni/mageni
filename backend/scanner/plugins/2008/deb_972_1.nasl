For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in

We recommend that you upgrade your pdfkit.framework package.

announced via advisory DSA 972-1.

SuSE researchers discovered heap overflow errors in xpdf, the Portable
Document Format (PDF) suite, which is also present in
pdfkit.framework, the GNUstep framework for rendering PDF content, and
which can allow attackers to cause a denial of service by crashing the
application or possibly execute arbitrary code.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain pdfkit.framework
packages.";
