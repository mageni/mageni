For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your pdftohtml package.

announced via advisory DSA 962-1.

infamous41md and Chris Evans discovered several heap based buffer
overflows in xpdf which are also present in pdftohtml, a utility that
translates PDF documents into HTML format, and which can lead to a
denial of service by crashing the application or possibly to the
execution of arbitrary code.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain pdftohtml packages.";
