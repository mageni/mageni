tag_summary = "The remote host is missing updates to the kernel announced in
advisory RHSA-2009:0009.

These updated packages address the following security issues:

* Tavis Ormandy discovered a deficiency in the Linux kernel 32-bit and
64-bit emulation. This could allow a local, unprivileged user to prepare
and run a specially-crafted binary which would use this deficiency to leak
uninitialized and potentially sensitive data. (CVE-2008-0598, Important)

* Olaf Kirch reported a flaw in the i915 kernel driver that only affects
the Intel G33 series and newer. This flaw could, potentially, lead to local
privilege escalation. (CVE-2008-3831, Important)

* Miklos Szeredi reported a missing check for files opened with O_APPEND in
sys_splice(). This could allow a local, unprivileged user to bypass the
append-only file restrictions. (CVE-2008-4554, Important)

* a deficiency was found in the Linux kernel Stream Control Transmission
Protocol (SCTP) implementation. This could lead to a possible denial of
service if one end of a SCTP connection did not support the AUTH extension.
(CVE-2008-4576, Important)

* Wei Yongjun reported a flaw in the Linux kernel SCTP implementation. In
certain code paths, sctp_sf_violation_paramlen() could be called with a
wrong parameter data type. This could lead to a possible denial of service.
(CVE-2008-4618, Important)

* when fput() was called to close a socket, the __scm_destroy() function in
the Linux kernel could make indirect recursive calls to itself. This could,
potentially, lead to a denial of service issue. (CVE-2008-5029, Important)

* the ext2 and ext3 filesystem code failed to properly handle corrupted
data structures, leading to a possible local denial of service issue when
read or write operations were performed. (CVE-2008-3528, Low)

All Red Hat Enterprise MRG users should install this update which addresses
these vulnerabilities and fixes these bugs.";
