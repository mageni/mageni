advisory RHSA-2009:1075.

The Apache HTTP Server is a popular and freely-available Web server.

A flaw was found in the handling of compression structures between mod_ssl
and OpenSSL. If too many connections were opened in a short period of time,
all system memory and swap space would be consumed by httpd, negatively
impacting other processes, or causing a system crash. (CVE-2008-1678)

Note: The CVE-2008-1678 issue did not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5
prior to 5.3. The problem was introduced via the RHBA-2009:0181 errata in
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3, which upgraded OpenSSL to the newer 0.9.8e
version.

A flaw was found in the handling of the Options and AllowOverride
directives. In configurations using the AllowOverride directive with
certain Options= arguments, local users were not restricted from
executing commands from a Server-Side-Include script as intended.
(CVE-2009-1195)

All httpd users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to resolve these issues. Users must restart httpd for
this update to take effect.";

tag_solution = "Please note that this update is available via
Red Hat Network.  To use Red Hat Network, launch the Red
Hat Update Agent with the following command: up2date";
