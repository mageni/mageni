tag_insight = "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  These updated packages fix the following security issues:
  
  * the absence of a protection mechanism when attempting to access a
  critical section of code has been found in the Linux kernel open file
  descriptors control mechanism, fcntl. This could allow a local unprivileged
  user to simultaneously execute code, which would otherwise be protected
  against parallel execution. As well, a race condition when handling locks
  in the Linux kernel fcntl functionality, may have allowed a process
  belonging to a local unprivileged user to gain re-ordered access to the
  descriptor table. (CVE-2008-1669, Important)
  
  * the absence of a protection mechanism when attempting to access a
  critical section of code, as well as a race condition, have been found in
  the Linux kernel file system event notifier, dnotify. This could allow a
  local unprivileged user to get inconsistent data, or to send arbitrary
  signals to arbitrary system processes. (CVE-2008-1375, Important)
  
  Red Hat would like to thank Nick Piggin for responsibly disclosing the
  following issue:
  
  * when accessing kernel memory locations, certain Linux kernel drivers
  registering a fault handler did not perform required range checks. A local
  unprivileged user could use this flaw to gain read or write access to
  arbitrary kernel memory, or possibly cause a kernel crash.
  (CVE-2008-0007, Important)
  
  * a flaw was found when performing asynchronous input or output operations
  on a FIFO special file. A local unprivileged user could use this flaw to
  cause a kernel panic. (CVE-2007-5001, Important)
  
  * a flaw was found in the way core dump files were created. If a local user
  could get a root-owned process to dump a core file into a directory, which
  the user has write access to, they could gain read access to that core
  file. This could potentially grant unauthorized access to sensitive
  information. (CVE-2007-6206, Moderate)
  
  * a buffer overflow was found in the Linux kernel ISDN subsystem. A local
  unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service.
  (CVE-2007-6151, Moderate)
  
  * a race condition found in the mincore system core could allow a local
  user to cause a denial of service (system hang). (CVE-2006-4814, Moderate)
  
  * it was discovered that the Linux kernel handled string operations in the
  opposite way to the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). This could allow a local
  unprivileged user to cause memory corruption. (CVE-2008-1367, Low)
