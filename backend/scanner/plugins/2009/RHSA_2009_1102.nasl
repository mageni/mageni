advisory RHSA-2009:1102.

cscope is a mature, ncurses-based, C source-code tree browsing tool.

Multiple buffer overflow flaws were found in cscope. An attacker could
create a specially crafted source code file that could cause cscope to
crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code when browsed with cscope.
(CVE-2004-2541, CVE-2009-0148)

All users of cscope are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
contains backported patches to fix these issues. All running instances of
cscope must be restarted for this update to take effect.";
