  An integer underflow flaw and a boundary error flaw, both possibly leading
  to a heap-based buffer overflow, were found in the way OpenOffice.org
  parses certain records in Microsoft Word documents. An attacker could
  create a specially-crafted Microsoft Word document, which once opened by an
  unsuspecting user, could cause OpenOffice.org to crash or, potentially,
  execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running
  OpenOffice.org. (CVE-2009-0200, CVE-2009-0201)
