  Daniel Stenberg reported that Wget is affected by the previously published
  'null prefix attack', caused by incorrect handling of NULL characters in
  X.509 certificates. If an attacker is able to get a carefully-crafted
  certificate signed by a trusted Certificate Authority, the attacker could
  use the certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and potentially
  confuse Wget into accepting it by mistake. (CVE-2009-3490)
