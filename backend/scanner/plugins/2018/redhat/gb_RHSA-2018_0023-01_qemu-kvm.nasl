  package provides the user-space component for running virtual machines that use
  KVM. Security Fix(es): * An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern
  microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of instructions (a
  commonly used performance optimization). There are three primary variants of the
  issue which differ in the way the speculative execution can be exploited.
  Variant CVE-2017-5715 triggers the speculative execution by utilizing branch
  target injection. It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction
  sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory accesses may
  cause allocation into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively
  executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an
  unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to cross the syscall and guest/host
  boundaries and read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel
  attacks. (CVE-2017-5715) Note: This is the qemu-kvm side of the CVE-2017-5715
  mitigation. Red Hat would like to thank Google Project Zero for reporting this
  issue.");
