  would be tried until a suitable one was found, an attacker could have the server accept tickets
  encrypted with any key, including their own.

  A user could thus change the password of the Administrator account and gain total control over the
  domain. Full loss of confidentiality and integrity would be possible, as well as of availability
  by denying users access to their accounts.

  In addition, the kpasswd service would accept tickets encrypted by the krbtgt key of an RODC, in
  spite of the fact that RODCs should not have been able to authorise password changes.");
