  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"ISC BIND through 9.9.9-P1, 9.10.x through 9.10.4-P1, and 9.11.x through 9.11.0b1 allows primary DNS servers to cause a denial of service (secondary DNS server crash) via a large AXFR response, and possibly allows IXFR servers to cause a denial of service (IXFR client crash) via a large IXFR response and allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (primary DNS server crash) via a large UPDATE message.(CVE-2016-6170)

It was found that the controls for zone transfer were not properly applied to Dynamically Loadable Zones (DLZs). An attacker acting as a DNS client could use this flaw to request and receive a zone transfer of a DLZ even when not permitted to do so by the 'allow-transfer' ACL.(CVE-2019-6465)

To provide fine-grained controls over the ability to use Dynamic DNS (DDNS) to update records in a zone, BIND 9 provides a feature called update-policy. Various rules can be configured to limit the types of updates that can be performed by a client, depending on the key used when sending the update request. Unfortunately, some rule types were not initially documented, and when documentation for them was added to the Administrator Reference Manual (ARM) in change #3112, the language that was added to the ARM at that time incorrectly described the behavior of two rule types, krb5-subdomain and ms-subdomain. This incorrect documentation could mislead operators into believing that policies they had configured were more restrictive than they actually were. This affects BIND versions prior to BIND 9.11.5 and BIND 9.12.3.(CVE-2018-5741)

An assertion failure was found in the way bind implemented the 'managed keys' feature. An attacker could use this flaw to cause the named daemon to crash. This flaw is very difficult for an attacker to trigger because it requires an operator to have BIND configured to use a trust anchor managed by the attacker.(CVE-2018-5745)");
