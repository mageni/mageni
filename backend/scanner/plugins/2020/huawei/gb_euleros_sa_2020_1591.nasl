This is quite similar to CVE-2013-0269, but does not rely on poor garbage-collection behavior within Ruby. Specifically, use of JSON parsing methods can lead to creation of a malicious object within the interpreter, with adverse effects that are application-dependent.(CVE-2020-10663)

An issue was discovered in Ruby 2.5.x through 2.5.7, 2.6.x through 2.6.5, and 2.7.0. If a victim calls BasicSocket#read_nonblock(requested_size, buffer, exception: false), the method resizes the buffer to fit the requested size, but no data is copied. Thus, the buffer string provides the previous value of the heap. This may expose possibly sensitive data from the interpreter.(CVE-2020-10933)");
