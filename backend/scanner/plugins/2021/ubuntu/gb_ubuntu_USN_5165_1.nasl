It was discovered that the SCTP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel
did not properly verify VTAGs in some situations. A remote attacker could
possibly use this to cause a denial of service (connection disassociation).

It was discovered that the AMD Radeon GPU driver in the Linux kernel did
not properly validate writes in the debugfs file system. A privileged
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-42327)

Luo Likang discovered that the FireDTV Firewire driver in the Linux kernel
did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. A local
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-42739)

It was discovered that the KVM implementation for POWER8 processors in the
Linux kernel did not properly keep track if a wakeup event could be
resolved by a guest. An attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to
cause a denial of service (host OS crash). (CVE-2021-43056)

did not properly validate MSG_CRYPTO messages in some situations. An
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-43267)

It was discovered that the ISDN CAPI implementation in the Linux kernel

array out-of-bounds bug. A privileged local attacker could possibly use
this to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code.
