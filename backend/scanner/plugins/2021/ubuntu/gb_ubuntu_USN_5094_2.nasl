kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some situations,
leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker who could start and
control a VM could possibly use this to expose sensitive information or
execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-22543)

It was discovered that the tracing subsystem in the Linux kernel did not
properly keep track of per-cpu ring buffer state. A privileged attacker
could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2021-3679)

Alois Wohlschlager discovered that the overlay file system in the Linux
kernel did not restrict private clones in some situations. An attacker
could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2021-3732)

It was discovered that the MAX-3421 host USB device driver in the Linux
kernel did not properly handle device removal events. A physically
proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system
crash). (CVE-2021-38204)

It was discovered that the Xilinx 10/100 Ethernet Lite device driver in the
Linux kernel could report pointer addresses in some situations. An attacker
could use this information to ease the exploitation of another
vulnerability. (CVE-2021-38205)");
