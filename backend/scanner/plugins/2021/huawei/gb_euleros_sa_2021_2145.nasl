There is a heap based buffer overflow in tools/tiff2pdf.c of LibTIFF 4.0.8 via a PlanarConfig=Contig image, which causes a more than one hundred bytes out-of-bounds write (related to the ZIPDecode function in tif_zip.c). A crafted input may lead to a remote denial of service attack or an arbitrary code execution attack.(CVE-2017-11335)

In LibTIFF 4.0.7, a memory leak vulnerability was found in the function OJPEGReadHeaderInfoSecTablesQTable in tif_ojpeg.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted file.(CVE-2017-9404)

ChopUpSingleUncompressedStrip in tif_dirread.c in LibTIFF 4.0.9 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted TIFF file, as demonstrated by tiff2pdf.(CVE-2018-15209)

newoffsets handling in ChopUpSingleUncompressedStrip in tif_dirread.c in LibTIFF 4.0.9 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted TIFF file, as demonstrated by tiff2pdf. This is a different vulnerability than CVE-2018-15209.(CVE-2018-16335)

In LibTIFF 4.0.9, there is an uncontrolled resource consumption in the TIFFSetDirectory function of tif_dir.c. Remote attackers could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial of service via a crafted tif file. This occurs because the declared number of directory entries is not validated against the actual number of directory entries.(CVE-2018-5784)");
