An issue was discovered in Pillow before 8.2.0. PSDImagePlugin.PsdImageFile lacked a sanity check on the number of input layers relative to the size of the data block. This could lead to a DoS on Image.open prior to Image.load.(CVE-2021-28675)

An issue was discovered in Pillow before 8.2.0. For EPS data, the readline implementation used in EPSImageFile has to deal with any combination of \r and \n as line endings. It used an accidentally quadratic method of accumulating lines while looking for a line ending. A malicious EPS file could use this to perform a DoS of Pillow in the open phase, before an image was accepted for opening.(CVE-2021-28677)

An issue was discovered in Pillow before 8.2.0. For FLI data, FliDecode did not properly check that the block advance was non-zero, potentially leading to an infinite loop on load.(CVE-2021-28676)

Pillow through 8.2.0 and PIL (aka Python Imaging Library) through 1.1.7 allow an attacker to pass controlled parameters directly into a convert function to trigger a buffer overflow in Convert.c.(CVE-2021-34552)

The package pillow 5.2.0 and before 8.3.2 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the getrgb function.(CVE-2021-23437)");
