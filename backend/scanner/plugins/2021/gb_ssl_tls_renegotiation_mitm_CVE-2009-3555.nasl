  handshake (Renegotiation) over an existing / already established SSL/TLS connection.");

  properly associate renegotiation handshakes with an existing connection, which allows MITM
  attackers to insert data into HTTPS sessions, and possibly other types of sessions protected by
  TLS or SSL, by sending an unauthenticated request that is processed retroactively by a server in a
  post-renegotiation context, related to a 'plaintext injection' attack, aka the 'Project Mogul'
  issue.");
