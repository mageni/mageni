  A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handled security wrappers.
  Malicious content could cause Thunderbird to execute arbitrary code with
  the privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-4193)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges moz_bug_r_a4 as the original reporter.

  Note: This issue cannot be exploited by a specially-crafted HTML mail
  message as JavaScript is disabled by default for mail messages. It could be
  exploited another way in Thunderbird, for example, when viewing the full
  remote content of an RSS feed.

  All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
  corrects this issue. After installing the update, Thunderbird must be
  restarted for the changes to take effect.");
