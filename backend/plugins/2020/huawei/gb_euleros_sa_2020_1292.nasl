  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"In the Linux kernel 5.0.21, mounting a crafted ext4 filesystem image, performing some operations, and unmounting can lead to a use-after-free in ext4_put_super in fs/ext4/super.c, related to dump_orphan_list in fs/ext4/super.c.(CVE-2019-19447 )

In the Linux kernel 5.4.0-rc2, there is a use-after-free (read) in the __blk_add_trace function in kernel/trace/blktrace.c (which is used to fill out a blk_io_trace structure and place it in a per-cpu sub-buffer).(CVE-2019-19768)

ext4_protect_reserved_inode in fs/ext4/block_validity.c in the Linux kernel through 5.5.3 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (soft lockup) via a crafted journal size.(CVE-2020-8992)

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.5.6. set_fdc in drivers/block/floppy.c leads to a wait_til_ready out-of-bounds read because the FDC index is not checked for errors before assigning it, aka CID-2e90ca68b0d2.(CVE-2020-9383)

In the Linux kernel before 5.3.11, sound/core/timer.c has a use-after-free caused by erroneous code refactoring, aka CID-e7af6307a8a5. This is related to snd_timer_open and snd_timer_close_locked. The timeri variable was originally intended to be for a newly created timer instance, but was used for a different purpose after refactoring.(CVE-2019-19807)

Kernel: kvm: nVMX: L2 guest may trick the L0 hypervisor to access sensitive L1 resources(CVE-2020-2732)

There is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel through 5.5.2 in the n_tty_receive_buf_common function in drivers/tty/n_tty.c.(CVE-2020-8648)

There is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel through 5.5.2 in the vgacon_invert_region function in drivers/video/console/vgacon.c.(CVE-2020-8649)

There is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel through 5.5.2 in the vc_do_resize function in drivers/tty/vt/vt.c.(CVE-2020-8647)

fs/namei.c in the Linux kernel before 5.5 has a may_create_in_sticky use-after-free, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (OOPS) or possibly obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, aka CID-d0cb50185ae9. One attack vector may be an open system call for a UNIX domain socket, if the socket is being moved to a new parent directory and its old parent directory is being removed.(CVE-2020-8428)

In a Linux KVM guest that has PV TLB enabled, a process in the guest kernel may be able to read memory locations from another process in the same guest. This problem is limit to the host running linux kernel 4.10 with a guest running linux kernel 4.16 or later. The problem mainly affects AMD processors but Intel CPUs cannot be ruled out.(CVE-2019-3016)");
