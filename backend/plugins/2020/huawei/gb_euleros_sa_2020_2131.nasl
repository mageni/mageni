This is related to sysdeps/ieee754/ldbl-96/e_rem_pio2l.c.(CVE-2020-10029)

A use-after-free vulnerability introduced in glibc upstream version 2.14 was found in the way the tilde expansion was carried out. Directory paths containing an initial tilde followed by a valid username were affected by this issue. A local attacker could exploit this flaw by creating a specially crafted path that, when processed by the glob function, would potentially lead to arbitrary code execution. This was fixed in version 2.32.(CVE-2020-1752)");
