Unsolicited Commercial Email (SPAM) from your incoming email.  It can
be invoked by a MDA such as sendmail or postfix, or can be called from
a procmail script, .forward file, etc.  It uses a genetic-algorithm
evolved scoring system to identify messages which look spammy, then
adds headers to the message so they can be filtered by the user&#39, s mail
reading software.  This distribution includes the spamd/spamc components
which create a server that considerably speeds processing of mail.

To enable spamassassin, if you are receiving mail locally, simply add
this line to your ~/.procmailrc:
INCLUDERC=/etc/mail/spamassassin/spamassassin-default.rc

To filter spam for all users, add that line to /etc/procmailrc
(creating if necessary).");
