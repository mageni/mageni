  It was discovered that Ruby's REXML library did not properly restrict XML
  entity expansion. An attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of
  service by tricking a Ruby application using REXML to read text nodes from
  specially-crafted XML content, which will result in REXML consuming large
  amounts of system memory. (CVE-2013-1821)

  It was found that the RHSA-2011:0910 update did not correctly fix the
  CVE-2011-1005 issue, a flaw in the method for translating an exception
  message into a string in the Exception class. A remote attacker could use
  this flaw to bypass safe level 4 restrictions, allowing untrusted (tainted)
  code to modify arbitrary, trusted (untainted) strings, which safe level 4
  restrictions would otherwise prevent. (CVE-2012-4481)

  The CVE-2012-4481 issue was discovered by Vit Ondruch of Red Hat.

  All users of Ruby are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to resolve these issues.");
