  * An information leak flaw was found in the way the Xen hypervisor handled
error conditions when reading guest memory during certain guest-originated
operations, such as port or memory mapped I/O writes. A privileged user in
a fully-virtualized guest could use this flaw to leak hypervisor stack
memory to a guest. (CVE-2013-4355, Moderate)

Red Hat would like to thank the Xen project for reporting this issue.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * A previous fix to the kernel did not contain a memory barrier in the
percpu_up_write() function. Consequently, under certain circumstances, a
race condition could occur leading to memory corruption and a subsequent
kernel panic. This update introduces a new memory barrier pair, light_mb()
and heavy_mb(), for per-CPU basis read and write semaphores
(percpu-rw-semaphores) ensuring that the race condition can no longer
occur. In addition, the read path performance of 'percpu-rw-semaphores' has
been improved. (BZ#1014715)

  * Due to a bug in the tg3 driver, systems that had the Wake-on-LAN (WOL)
feature enabled on their NICs could not have been woken up from suspension
or hibernation using WOL. A missing pci_wake_from_d3() function call has
been added to the tg3 driver, which ensures that WOL functions properly by
setting the PME_ENABLE bit. (BZ#1014973)

  * Due to an incorrect test condition in the mpt2sas driver, the driver was
unable to catch failures to map a SCSI scatter-gather list. The test
condition has been corrected so that the mpt2sas driver now handles SCSI
scatter-gather mapping failures as expected. (BZ#1018458)

  * A previous patch to the kernel introduced the 'VLAN tag re-insertion'
workaround to resolve a problem with incorrectly handled VLAN-tagged
packets with no assigned VLAN group while the be2net driver was in
promiscuous mode. However, this solution led to packet corruption and a
subsequent kernel oops if such a processed packed was a GRO packet.
Therefore, a patch has been applied to restrict VLAN tag re-insertion only
to non-GRO packets. The be2net driver now processes VLAN-tagged packets
with no assigned VLAN group correctly in this situation. (BZ#1023348)

All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be
rebooted for this update to take effect.");
