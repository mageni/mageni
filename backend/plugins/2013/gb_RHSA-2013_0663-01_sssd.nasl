  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"SSSD (System Security Services Daemon) provides a set of daemons to manage
  access to remote directories and authentication mechanisms. It provides
  NSS (Name Service Switch) and PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules)
  interfaces toward the system and a pluggable back end system to connect to
  multiple different account sources.

  When SSSD was configured as a Microsoft Active Directory client by using
  the new Active Directory provider (introduced in RHSA-2013:0508), the
  Simple Access Provider (access_provider = simple in /etc/sssd/sssd.conf)
  did not handle access control correctly. If any groups were specified
  with the simple_deny_groups option (in sssd.conf), all users were
  permitted access. (CVE-2013-0287)

  The CVE-2013-0287 issue was discovered by Kaushik Banerjee of Red Hat.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * If a group contained a member whose Distinguished Name (DN) pointed out
  of any of the configured search bases, the search request that was
  processing this particular group never ran to completion. To the user, this
  bug manifested as a long timeout between requesting the group data and
  receiving the result. A patch has been provided to address this bug and
  SSSD now processes group search requests without delays. (BZ#907362)

  * The pwd_expiration_warning should have been set for seven days, but
  instead it was set to zero for Kerberos. This incorrect zero setting
  returned the always display warning if the server sends one error message
  and users experienced problems in environments like IPA or Active
  Directory. Currently, the value setting for Kerberos is modified and this
  issue no longer occurs. (BZ#914671)

  All users of sssd are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.");
