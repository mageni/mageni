tag_insight = "Mozilla Firefox is an open source Web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
  Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

  A use-after-free flaw was found in Firefox. Under low memory conditions,
  visiting a web page containing malicious content could result in Firefox
  executing arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
  (CVE-2009-1571)
  
  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  Firefox. (CVE-2010-0159, CVE-2010-0160)
  
  Two flaws were found in the way certain content was processed. An attacker
  could use these flaws to create a malicious web page that could bypass the
  same-origin policy, or possibly run untrusted JavaScript. (CVE-2009-3988,
  CVE-2010-0162)
  
  For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
  advisories for Firefox 3.0.18. You can find a link to the Mozilla
  advisories in the References section of this errata.
  
  All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  Firefox version 3.0.18, which corrects these issues. After installing the
  update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.";
