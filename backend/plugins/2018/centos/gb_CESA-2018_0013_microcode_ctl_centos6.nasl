Security Fix(es):

  * An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor
designs have implemented speculative execution of instructions (a commonly
used performance optimization). There are three primary variants of the
issue which differ in the way the speculative execution can be exploited.
Variant CVE-2017-5715 triggers the speculative execution by utilizing
branch target injection. It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined
instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory
accesses may cause allocation into the microprocessor's data cache even for
speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As
a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to cross the syscall
and guest/host boundaries and read privileged memory by conducting targeted
cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2017-5715)

Note: This is the microcode counterpart of the CVE-2017-5715 kernel
mitigation.

Red Hat would like to thank Google Project Zero for reporting this issue.");
