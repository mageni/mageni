  * A flaw was found in the kernel's implementation of the Berkeley Packet
Filter (BPF). A local attacker could craft BPF code to crash the system by
creating a situation in which the JIT compiler would fail to correctly
optimize the JIT image on the last pass. This would lead to the CPU
executing instructions that were not part of the JIT code. (CVE-2015-4700,
Important)

  * Two flaws were found in the way the Linux kernel's networking
implementation handled UDP packets with incorrect checksum values. A remote
attacker could potentially use these flaws to trigger an infinite loop in
the kernel, resulting in a denial of service on the system, or cause a
denial of service in applications using the edge triggered epoll
functionality. (CVE-2015-5364, CVE-2015-5366, Important)

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's ext4 file system handled
the 'page size   block size' condition when the fallocate zero range
functionality was used. A local attacker could use this flaw to crash the
system. (CVE-2015-0275, Moderate)

  * It was found that the Linux kernel's keyring implementation would leak
memory when adding a key to a keyring via the add_key() function. A local
attacker could use this flaw to exhaust all available memory on the system.
(CVE-2015-1333, Moderate)

  * A race condition flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's SCTP
implementation handled Address Configuration lists when performing Address
Configuration Change (ASCONF). A local attacker could use this flaw to
crash the system via a race condition triggered by setting certain ASCONF
options on a socket. (CVE-2015-3212, Moderate)

  * An information leak flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Virtual
Dynamic Shared Object (vDSO) implementation performed address
randomization. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to leak
kernel memory addresses to user-space. (CVE-2014-9585, Low)

Red Hat would like to thank Daniel Borkmann for reporting CVE-2015-4700,
and Canonical for reporting the CVE-2015-1333 issue. The CVE-2015-0275
issue was discovered by Xiong Zhou of Red Hat, and the CVE-2015-3212 issue
was discovered by Ji Jianwen of Red Hat Engineering.

This update also fixes several bugs. Refer to the linked Knowledgebase
article for further information.

All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be
rebooted for this update to take effect.");
