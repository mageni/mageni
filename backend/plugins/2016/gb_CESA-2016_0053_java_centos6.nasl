An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the JPEG image format decoder in
the AWT component in OpenJDK. A specially crafted JPEG image could cause
a Java application to crash or, possibly execute arbitrary code. An
untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to bypass Java
sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2016-0483)

An integer signedness issue was found in the font parsing code in the 2D
component in OpenJDK. A specially crafted font file could possibly cause
the Java Virtual Machine to execute arbitrary code, allowing an untrusted
Java application or applet to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.
(CVE-2016-0494)

It was discovered that the JAXP component in OpenJDK did not properly
enforce the totalEntitySizeLimit limit. An attacker able to make a Java
application process a specially crafted XML file could use this flaw to
make the application consume an excessive amount of memory. (CVE-2016-0466)

A flaw was found in the way TLS 1.2 could use the MD5 hash function for
signing ServerKeyExchange and Client Authentication packets during a TLS
handshake. A man-in-the-middle attacker able to force a TLS connection to
use the MD5 hash function could use this flaw to conduct collision attacks
to impersonate a TLS server or an authenticated TLS client. (CVE-2015-7575)

Multiple flaws were discovered in the Libraries, Networking, and JMX
components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use
these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2015-4871,
CVE-2016-0402, CVE-2016-0448)

Note: If the web browser plug-in provided by the icedtea-web package was
installed, the issues exposed via Java applets could have been exploited
without user interaction if a user visited a malicious website.

Note: This update also disallows the use of the MD5 hash algorithm in the
certification path processing. The use of MD5 can be re-enabled by removing
MD5 from the jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms security property defined in
the java.security file.

All users of java-1.7.0-openjdk are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which resolve these issues. All running instances of OpenJDK Java
must be restarted for the update to take effect.");
