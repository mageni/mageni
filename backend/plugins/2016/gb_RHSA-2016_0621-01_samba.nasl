  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Samba is an open-source implementation of the
Server Message Block (SMB) protocol and the related Common Internet File System
(CIFS) protocol, which allow PC-compatible machines to share files, printers, and
various information.

Security Fix(es):

  * A protocol flaw, publicly referred to as Badlock, was found in the
Security Account Manager Remote Protocol (MS-SAMR) and the Local Security
Authority (Domain Policy) Remote Protocol (MS-LSAD). Any authenticated
DCE/RPC connection that a client initiates against a server could be used
by a man-in-the-middle attacker to impersonate the authenticated user
against the SAMR or LSA service on the server. As a result, the attacker
would be able to get read/write access to the Security Account Manager
database, and use this to reveal all passwords or any other potentially
sensitive information in that database. (CVE-2016-2118)

  * Several flaws were found in Samba's implementation of NTLMSSP
authentication. An unauthenticated, man-in-the-middle attacker could use
this flaw to clear the encryption and integrity flags of a connection,
causing data to be transmitted in plain text. The attacker could also force
the client or server into sending data in plain text even if encryption was
explicitly requested for that connection. (CVE-2016-2110)

  * It was discovered that Samba configured as a Domain Controller would
establish a secure communication channel with a machine using a spoofed
computer name. A remote attacker able to observe network traffic could use
this flaw to obtain session-related information about the spoofed machine.
(CVE-2016-2111)

  * It was found that Samba's LDAP implementation did not enforce integrity
protection for LDAP connections. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use
this flaw to downgrade LDAP connections to use no integrity protection,
allowing them to hijack such connections. (CVE-2016-2112)

  * It was found that Samba did not enable integrity protection for IPC
traffic by default. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to
view and modify the data sent between a Samba server and a client.
(CVE-2016-2115)

Red Hat would like to thank the Samba project for reporting these issues.
