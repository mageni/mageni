Security Fix(es):

It was found that the RFC 5961 challenge ACK rate limiting as implemented
in the Linux kernel's networking subsystem allowed an off-path attacker to
leak certain information about a given connection by creating congestion on
the global challenge ACK rate limit counter and then measuring the changes
by probing packets. An off-path attacker could use this flaw to either
terminate TCP connection and/or inject payload into non-secured TCP
connection between two endpoints on the network. (CVE-2016-5696, Important)

Red Hat would like to thank Yue Cao (Cyber Security Group of the CS
department of University of California in Riverside) for reporting this
issue.

Bug Fix(es):

  * When loading the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) kernel module, the kernel
panicked if DRM was previously unloaded. The kernel panic was caused by a
memory leak of the ID Resolver (IDR2). With this update, IDR2 is loaded
during kernel boot, and the kernel panic no longer occurs in the described
scenario. (BZ#1353827)

  * When more than one process attempted to use the 'configfs' directory
entry at the same time, a kernel panic in some cases occurred. With this
update, a race condition between a directory entry and a lookup operation
has been fixed. As a result, the kernel no longer panics in the described
scenario. (BZ#1353828)

  * When shutting down the system by running the halt -p command, a kernel
panic occurred due to a conflict between the kernel offlining CPUs and the
sched command, which used the sched group and the sched domain data without
first checking the data. The underlying source code has been fixed by
adding a check to avoid the conflict. As a result, the described scenario
no longer results in a kernel panic. (BZ#1343894)

  * In some cases, running the ipmitool command caused a kernel panic due to
a race condition in the ipmi message handler. This update fixes the race
condition, and the kernel panic no longer occurs in the described scenario.
(BZ#1355980)

  * Previously, multiple Very Secure FTP daemon (vsftpd) processes on a
directory with a large number of files led to a high contention rate on
each inode's spinlock, which caused excessive CPU usage. With this update,
a spinlock to protect a single memory-to-memory copy has been removed from
the ext4_getattr() function. As a result, system CPU usage has been reduced
and is no longer excessive in the described situation. (BZ#1355981)

  * When the gfs2_grow utility is used to extend Global File System 2 (GFS2),
the next block allocation causes the GFS2 kernel modu ...
