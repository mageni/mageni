  script_tag(name:"summary", value:"A vulnerability in Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) authentication in the Cisco Nexus series could
allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to affect the state of HSRP group members and cause
black holing of traffic.

The vulnerability is due to incorrect parsing of malformed HSRP packets. An attacker could exploit
this vulnerability by sending malformed HSRP packets to bypass HSRP authentication. An exploit could
allow the attacker to bypass HSRP authentication and affect the state of active HSRP group members,
causing them to go to SPEAK state, which leads to black holing of traffic and causes a denial of
service (DoS) condition.

Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice. However, software updates are not
available.


Although an attacker does not need to authenticate to a targeted device to exploit this
vulnerability, the attacker must be on the same collision or broadcast domain of the targeted
device. This access requirement may reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit.

Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists. However, the code is not
known to be publicly available.");
