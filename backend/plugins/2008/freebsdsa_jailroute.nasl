tag_insight = "The jail(2) system call allows a system administrator to lock up a
process and all its descendants inside a closed environment with very
limited ability to affect the system outside that environment, even
for processes with superuser privileges.  It is an extension of, but
far more stringent than, the traditional Unix chroot(2) system call.

The FreeBSD kernel maintains internal routing tables for the purpose
of determining which interface should be used to transmit packets.
These routing tables can be manipulated by user processes running
with superuser privileges by sending messages over a routing socket.

A programming error resulting in a failure to verify that an attempt
to manipulate routing tables originated from a non-jailed process.";
