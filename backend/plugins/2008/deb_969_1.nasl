For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in

We recommend that you upgrade your scponly package.

announced via advisory DSA 969-1.

Max Vozeller discovered a vulnerability in scponly, a utility to
restrict user commands to scp and sftp, that could lead to the
execution of arbitray commands as root.  The system is only vulnerable
if the program scponlyc is installed setuid root and if regular users
have shell access to the machine.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain an scponly package.";
