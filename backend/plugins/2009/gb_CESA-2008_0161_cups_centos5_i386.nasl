  for UNIX(R) operating systems.

  A flaw was found in the way CUPS handled the addition and removal of remote
  shared printers via IPP.  A remote attacker could send malicious UDP IPP
  packets causing the CUPS daemon to attempt to dereference already freed
  memory and crash. (CVE-2008-0597)
  
  A memory management flaw was found in the way CUPS handled the addition and
  removal of remote shared printers via IPP.  When shared printer was
  removed, allocated memory was not properly freed, leading to a memory leak
  possibly causing CUPS daemon crash after exhausting available memory.
  (CVE-2008-0596)
  
  These issues were found during the investigation of CVE-2008-0882, which
  did not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.
  
  Note that the default configuration of CUPS on Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  4 allow requests of this type only from the local subnet.
  
  All CUPS users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to resolve these issues.";
