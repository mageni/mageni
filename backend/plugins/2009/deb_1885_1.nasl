tag_insight = "Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xulrunner, a
runtime environment for XUL applications, such as the Iceweasel web
browser. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2009-3070

Jesse Ruderman discovered crashes in the layout engine, which
might allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2009-3071

Daniel Holbert, Jesse Ruderman, Olli Pettay and toshi discovered
crashes in the layout engine, which might allow the execution of
arbitrary code.

CVE-2009-3072

Josh Soref, Jesse Ruderman and Martin Wargers discovered crashes
in the layout engine, which might allow the execution of arbitrary
code.

CVE-2009-3074

Jesse Ruderman discovered a crash in the Javascript engine, which
might allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2009-3075

Carsten Book and Taral discovered crashes in the layout engine,
which might allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2009-3076

Jesse Ruderman discovered that the user interface for installing/
removing PCKS #11 securiy modules wasn't informative enough, which
might allow social engineering attacks.

CVE-2009-3077

It was discovered that incorrect pointer handling in the XUL parser
could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2009-3078

Juan Pablo Lopez Yacubian discovered that incorrent rendering of
some Unicode font characters could lead to spoofing attacks on
the location bar.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.9.0.14-0lenny1.

As indicated in the Etch release notes, security support for the
Mozilla products in the oldstable distribution needed to be stopped
before the end of the regular Etch security maintenance life cycle.
You are strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable or switch to a still
supported browser.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.0.14-1.

For the experimental distribution, these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.1.3-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your xulrunner package.";
