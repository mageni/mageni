tag_summary = "The remote host is missing updates announced in
advisory RHSA-2009:0270.

The gstreamer-plugins package contains plugins used by the GStreamer
streaming-media framework to support a wide variety of media types.

A heap buffer overflow was found in the GStreamer's QuickTime media file
format decoding plug-in. An attacker could create a carefully-crafted
QuickTime media .mov file that would cause an application using GStreamer
to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code if played by a victim.
(CVE-2009-0397)

All users of gstreamer-plugins are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After
installing the update, all applications using GStreamer (such as rhythmbox)
must be restarted for the changes to take effect.";

tag_solution = "Please note that this update is available via
Red Hat Network.  To use Red Hat Network, launch the Red
Hat Update Agent with the following command: up2date";
