tag_summary = "The remote host is missing updates announced in
advisory RHSA-2009:1671.

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues:

* a flaw was found in the Realtek r8169 Ethernet driver in the Linux
kernel. pci_unmap_single() presented a memory leak that could lead to IOMMU
space exhaustion and a system crash. An attacker on the local network could
trigger this flaw by using jumbo frames for large amounts of network
traffic. (CVE-2009-3613, Important)

* NULL pointer dereference flaws were found in the r128 driver in the Linux
kernel. Checks to test if the Concurrent Command Engine state was
initialized were missing in private IOCTL functions. An attacker could use
these flaws to cause a local denial of service or escalate their
privileges. (CVE-2009-3620, Important)

* an information leak was found in the Linux kernel. On AMD64 systems,
32-bit processes could access and read certain 64-bit registers by
temporarily switching themselves to 64-bit mode. (CVE-2009-2910, Moderate)

* the unix_stream_connect() function in the Linux kernel did not check if a
UNIX domain socket was in the shutdown state. This could lead to a
deadlock. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial
of service. (CVE-2009-3621, Moderate)

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this
update to take effect.";

tag_solution = "Please note that this update is available via
Red Hat Network.  To use Red Hat Network, launch the Red
Hat Update Agent with the following command: up2date";
