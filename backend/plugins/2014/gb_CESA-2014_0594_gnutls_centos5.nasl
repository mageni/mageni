  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"The GnuTLS library provides support for cryptographic
algorithms and for protocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS). The gnutls
packages also include the libtasn1 library, which provides Abstract Syntax
Notation One (ASN.1) parsing and structures management, and Distinguished
Encoding Rules (DER) encoding and decoding functions.

A flaw was found in the way GnuTLS parsed session IDs from ServerHello
messages of the TLS/SSL handshake. A malicious server could use this flaw
to send an excessively long session ID value, which would trigger a buffer
overflow in a connecting TLS/SSL client application using GnuTLS, causing
the client application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2014-3466)

It was discovered that the asn1_get_bit_der() function of the libtasn1
library incorrectly reported the length of ASN.1-encoded data. Specially
crafted ASN.1 input could cause an application using libtasn1 to perform
an out-of-bounds access operation, causing the application to crash or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-3468)

Multiple incorrect buffer boundary check issues were discovered in
libtasn1. Specially crafted ASN.1 input could cause an application using
libtasn1 to crash. (CVE-2014-3467)

Multiple NULL pointer dereference flaws were found in libtasn1's
asn1_read_value() function. Specially crafted ASN.1 input could cause an
application using libtasn1 to crash, if the application used the
aforementioned function in a certain way. (CVE-2014-3469)

Red Hat would like to thank GnuTLS upstream for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Joonas Kuorilehto of Codenomicon as the original
reporter of CVE-2014-3466.

Users of GnuTLS are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
correct these issues. For the update to take effect, all applications
linked to the GnuTLS or libtasn1 library must be restarted.");
