security-enabled client and server applications. Applications built with NSS can
support SSLv3, TLS, and other security standards.

It was found that the implementation of Internationalizing Domain Names in
Applications (IDNA) hostname matching in NSS did not follow the RFC 6125
recommendations. This could lead to certain invalid certificates with
international characters to be accepted as valid. (CVE-2014-1492)

In addition, the nss, nss-util, and nss-softokn packages have been upgraded
to upstream version 3.16.2, which provides a number of bug fixes and
enhancements over the previous versions. (BZ#1124659)

Users of NSS are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
correct these issues and add these enhancements. After installing this
update, applications using NSS must be restarted for this update to
take effect.");
