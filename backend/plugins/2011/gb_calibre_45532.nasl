traversal vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-
supplied input.

Exploiting these issues will allow an attacker to execute arbitrary
script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of
the affected site, and to view arbitrary local files and directories
within the context of the webserver. This may let the attacker steal
cookie-based authentication credentials and other harvested
information may aid in launching further attacks.

Calibre 0.7.34 is vulnerable. Other versions may also be affected.");
