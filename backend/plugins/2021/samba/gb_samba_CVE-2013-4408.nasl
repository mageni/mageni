  3.5.22, 3.6.0 - 3.6.21, 4.0.0 - 4.0.12 and including 4.1.2) are
  vulnerable to buffer overrun exploits in the client processing of
  DCE-RPC packets. This is due to incorrect checking of the DCE-RPC
  fragment length in the client code.

  This is a critical vulnerability as the DCE-RPC client code is part of
  the winbindd authentication and identity mapping daemon, which is
  commonly configured as part of many server installations (when joined
  to an Active Directory Domain). A malicious Active Directory Domain
  Controller or man-in-the-middle attacker impersonating an Active
  Directory Domain Controller could achieve root-level access by
  compromising the winbindd process.

  Samba server versions 3.4.0 - 3.4.17 and versions 3.5.0 - 3.5.22 are
  also vulnerable to a denial of service attack (server crash) due to a
  similar error in the server code of those versions.

  Samba server versions 3.6.0 and above (including all 3.6.x versions,
  all 4.0.x versions and 4.1.x) are not vulnerable to this problem.

  In addition range checks were missing on arguments returned from calls
  to the DCE-RPC functions LookupSids (lsa and samr), LookupNames (lsa and samr)
  and LookupRids (samr) which could also cause similar problems.

  As this was found during an internal audit of the Samba code there are
  no currently known exploits for this problem (as of December 9th 2013).");
