NULL-ptr deref in the spk_ttyio_receive_buf2() function in spk_ttyio.c.(CVE-2020-27830)

In do_epoll_ctl and ep_loop_check_proc of eventpoll.c, there is a possible use after free due to a logic error. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed.(CVE-2020-0466)

In the nl80211_policy policy of nl80211.c, there is a possible out of bounds read due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local information disclosure with System execution privileges needed.(CVE-2020-27068)

use-after-free read in sunkbd_reinit in drivers/input/keyboard/sunkbd.c.(CVE-2020-25669)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernels implementation of MIDI, where an attacker with a local account and the permissions to issue an ioctl commands to midi devices, could trigger a use-after-free. A write to this specific memory while freed and before use could cause the flow of execution to change and possibly allow for memory corruption or privilege escalation.(CVE-2020-27786)

An issue was discovered in romfs_dev_read in fs/romfs/storage.c in the Linux kernel before 5.8.4. Uninitialized memory leaks to userspace, aka CID-bcf85fcedfdd.(CVE-2020-29371)

A slab-out-of-bounds read in fbcon in the Linux kernel before 5.9.7 could be used by local attackers to read privileged information or potentially crash the kernel, aka CID-3c4e0dff2095. This occurs because KD_FONT_OP_COPY in drivers/tty/vt/vt.c can be used for manipulations such as font height.(CVE-2020-28974)

A locking inconsistency issue was discovered in the tty subsystem of the Linux kernel through 5.9.13. drivers/tty/tty_io.c and drivers/tty/tty_jobctrl.c may allow a read-after-free attack against TIOCGSID, aka CID-c8bcd9c5be24.(CVE-2020-29660)

A locking issue was discovered in the tty subsystem of the Linux kernel through 5.9.13. drivers/tty/tty_jobctrl.c allows a use-after-free attack against TIOCSPGRP, aka CID-54ffccbf053b.(CVE-2020-29661)

An issue was discovered in drivers/accessibility/speakup/spk_ttyio.c in the Linux kernel through 5.9.9. Local attackers on systems with the speakup driver could cause a local denial of service attack, aka CID-d41227544427. This occurs because of an invalid free when the line discipline is used more than once.(CVE-2020-28941)

A buffer over-read (at the framebuffer layer) in the fbcon code in the Linux kernel before 5.8.15 could be used by local attackers to read kernel memo ...
