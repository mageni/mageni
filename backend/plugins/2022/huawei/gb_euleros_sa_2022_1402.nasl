  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel through 5.14.9 allows unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds write.(CVE-2021-41864)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A memory leak in the ccp-ops crypto driver can allow attackers to cause a denial of service. This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.(CVE-2021-3744)

A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function that allows an attacker to cause a denial of service. The vulnerability is similar to the older CVE-2019-18808. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.(CVE-2021-3764)

A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source port randomization are indirectly affected as well.(CVE-2021-20322)

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in the detach_capi_ctr function in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c.(CVE-2021-43389)

A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.(CVE-2021-20321)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel netfilter implementation in versions prior to 5.5-rc7. A user with root (CAP_SYS_ADMIN) access is able to panic the system when issuing netfilter netflow commands.(CVE-2021-3635)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. Measuring usage of the shared memory does not scale with large shared memory segment counts which could lead to resource exhaustion and DoS.(CVE-2021-3669)

In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can introduce a crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value.(CVE-2021-43975)

The firewire subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.14.13 has a buffer overflow related to drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-avc.c and drivers/media/firewire/firedtv-ci.c, because avc_ca_pmt mishandles bounds checking.(CVE-2021-42739)

net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_standalone.c in the Linux kernel before 5.12.2 allows observation of changes in any net namespace because these changes are leaked into all other net namespaces. This is related to the NF_SYSCTL_CT_MAX, NF_SYSCTL_CT_EXPECT_MAX, and NF_SYSCTL_CT_BUCKETS sysctls.(CVE-2021-38209)
