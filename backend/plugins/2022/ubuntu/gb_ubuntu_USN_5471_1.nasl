Aaron Adams discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did
not properly handle the removal of stateful expressions in some situations,
leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this
to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2022-1966)

It was discovered that the IP implementation in the Linux kernel did not
provide sufficient randomization when calculating port offsets. An attacker
could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-1012)

Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the AX.25 amateur radio protocol
implementation in the Linux kernel, leading to use-after-free
vulnerabilities. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial
of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-1205)

It was discovered that the Marvell NFC device driver implementation in the
Linux kernel did not properly perform memory cleanup operations in some
situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker
could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system) or execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1734)

Minh Yuan discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel contained a
race condition in some situations, leading to a use-after-free
vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1836)

Ziming Zhang discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel
did not properly validate sets with multiple ranged fields. A local
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary
code. (CVE-2022-1972)

Joseph Ravichandran and Michael Wang discovered that the io_uring subsystem
in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize data in some situations. A
local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel
memory). (CVE-2022-29968)");
