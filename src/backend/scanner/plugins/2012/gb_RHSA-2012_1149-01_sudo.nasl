  An insecure temporary file use flaw was found in the sudo package's
  post-uninstall script. A local attacker could possibly use this flaw to
  overwrite an arbitrary file via a symbolic link attack, or modify the
  contents of the '/etc/nsswitch.conf' file during the upgrade or removal of
  the sudo package. (CVE-2012-3440)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, sudo escaped non-alphanumeric characters in commands using
  'sudo -s' or 'sudo -' at the wrong place and interfered with the
  authorization process. Some valid commands were not permitted. Now,
  non-alphanumeric characters escape immediately before the command is
  executed and no longer interfere with the authorization process.
  (BZ#844418)

  All users of sudo are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains backported patches to correct these issues.");
