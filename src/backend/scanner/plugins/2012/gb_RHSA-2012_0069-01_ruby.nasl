  A denial of service flaw was found in the implementation of associative
  arrays (hashes) in Ruby. An attacker able to supply a large number of
  inputs to a Ruby application (such as HTTP POST request parameters sent to
  a web application) that are used as keys when inserting data into an array
  could trigger multiple hash function collisions, making array operations
  take an excessive amount of CPU time. To mitigate this issue, randomization
  has been added to the hash function to reduce the chance of an attacker
  successfully causing intentional collisions. (CVE-2011-4815)

  Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting this issue. oCERT
  acknowledges Julian Waelde and Alexander Klink as the original reporters.

  All users of ruby are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to resolve this issue.");
