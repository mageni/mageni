  Multiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the Scripting,
  JMX, Concurrency, Libraries, and Security components in OpenJDK. An
  untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass
  certain Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2012-5068, CVE-2012-5071,
  CVE-2012-5069, CVE-2012-5073, CVE-2012-5072)

  It was discovered that java.util.ServiceLoader could create an instance of
  an incompatible class while performing provider lookup. An untrusted Java
  application or applet could use this flaw to bypass certain Java sandbox
  restrictions. (CVE-2012-5079)

  It was discovered that the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) SSL/TLS
  implementation did not properly handle handshake records containing an
  overly large data length value. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could
  possibly use this flaw to cause an SSL/TLS server to terminate with an
  exception. (CVE-2012-5081)

  It was discovered that the JMX component in OpenJDK could perform certain
  actions in an insecure manner. An untrusted Java application or applet
  could possibly use this flaw to disclose sensitive information.
  (CVE-2012-5075)

  A bug in the Java HotSpot Virtual Machine optimization code could cause it
  to not perform array initialization in certain cases. An untrusted Java
  application or applet could use this flaw to disclose portions of the
  virtual machine's memory. (CVE-2012-4416)

  It was discovered that the SecureRandom class did not properly protect
  against the creation of multiple seeders. An untrusted Java application or
  applet could possibly use this flaw to disclose sensitive information.
  (CVE-2012-5077)

  It was discovered that the java.io.FilePermission class exposed the hash
  code of the canonicalized path name. An untrusted Java application or
  applet could possibly use this flaw to determine certain system paths, such
  as the current working directory. (CVE-2012-3216)

  This update disables Gopher protocol support in the java.net package by
  default. Gopher support can be enabled by setting the newly introduced
  property, 'jdk.net.registerGopherProtocol', to true. (CVE-2012-5085)
