This represents a low severity confidentiality issue, as those users can eventually read any encrypted passwords present in grub.cfg. This flaw affects grub2 2.06 and previous versions. This issue has been fixed in grub upstream but no version with the fix is currently released.(CVE-2021-3981)

A flaw was found in grub2 when handling split HTTP headers. While processing a split HTTP header, grub2 wrongly advances its control pointer to the internal buffer by one position, which can lead to an out-of-bounds write. This flaw allows an attacker to leverage this issue by crafting a malicious s(CVE-2022-28734)

A flaw was found in grub2 when handling a PNG image header. When decoding the data contained in the Huffman table at the PNG file header, an out-of-bounds write may happen on grub's heap.(CVE-2021-3696)

A flaw was found in grub 2, where a crafted 16-bit grayscale PNG image may lead to an out-of-bounds write. This flaw allows an attacker to corrupt the data on the heap portion of the grub2's memory, leading to possible code execution and the circumvention of the secure boot mechanism.(CVE-2021-3695)");
