A flaw was found in libXpm. This issue occurs when parsing a file with a comment not closed, the end-of-file condition will not be detected, leading to an infinite loop and resulting in a Denial of Service in the application linked to the library.(CVE-2022-46285)

A flaw was found in libXpm. When processing a file with width of 0 and a very large height, some parser functions will be called repeatedly and can lead to an infinite loop, resulting in a Denial of Service in the application linked to the library.(CVE-2022-44617)");
