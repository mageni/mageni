If a client application that creates additional database connections only reuses the basic connection parameters while dropping security-relevant parameters, an opportunity for a man-in-the-middle attack, or the ability to observe clear-text transmissions, could exist. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.(CVE-2020-25694)

A man-in-the-middle attacker can inject false responses to the client's first few queries, despite the use of SSL certificate verification and encryption.(CVE-2021-23222)

It was found that a PostgreSQL server could accept plain text data during the establishment of an SSL connection. When a user is requesting a certificate based authentication, an active Person in the Middle could use this flaw in order to inject arbitrary SQL commands.(CVE-2021-23214)");
