An attacker who is able to supply a crafted file to be processed by an application linked with the affected functionality of libxml2 could trigger an out-of-bounds read. The most likely impact of this flaw is to application availability, with some potential impact to confidentiality and integrity if an attacker is able to use memory information to further exploit the application.(CVE-2021-3517)

valid.c in libxml2 before 2.9.13 has a use-after-free of ID and IDREF attributes.(CVE-2022-23308)

A vulnerability found in libxml2 in versions before 2.9.11 shows that it did not propagate errors while parsing XML mixed content, causing a NULL dereference. If an untrusted XML document was parsed in recovery mode and post-validated, the flaw could be used to crash the application. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.(CVE-2021-3537)

This library allows to manipulate XML files. It includes supportto read, modify and write XML and HTML files. There is DTDs supportthis includes parsing and validation even with complex DtDs, eitherat parse time or later once the document has been modified. The outputcan be a simple SAX stream or an(CVE-2021-3541)
