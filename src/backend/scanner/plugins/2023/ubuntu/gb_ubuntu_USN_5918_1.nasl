properly handle some RPC messages, leading to a buffer overflow. A remote
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-43945)

Tamas Koczka discovered that the Bluetooth L2CAP handshake implementation
in the Linux kernel contained multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities. A
physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-42896)

It was discovered that the Broadcom FullMAC USB WiFi driver in the Linux
kernel did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. A
physically proximate attacker could use this to craft a malicious USB
device that when inserted, could cause a denial of service (system crash)
or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3628)

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the
Bluetooth stack in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to
cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
code. (CVE-2022-3640)

It was discovered that the Xen netback driver in the Linux kernel did not
properly handle packets structured in certain ways. An attacker in a guest
VM could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (host NIC
availability). (CVE-2022-3643)

Khalid Masum discovered that the NILFS2 file system implementation in the
Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a
use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a
denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3649)

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the SMSC UFX USB driver
implementation in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free
vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a
denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Roccat HID driver in
the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-41850)

Tamas Koczka discovered that the Bluetooth L2CAP implementation in the
Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory in some situations. A
physically proximate attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive
information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-42895)

It was discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in the
Bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker
could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).
(CVE-2022-45934)

It was discovered that the binder IPC implementation in the Linux kernel
contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this
to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
code. (CVE-2023-20928)");
