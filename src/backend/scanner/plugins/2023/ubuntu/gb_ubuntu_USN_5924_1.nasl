Linux kernel did not properly handle sockets entering the LISTEN state in
certain protocols, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-0461)

It was discovered that the System V IPC implementation in the Linux kernel
did not properly handle large shared memory counts. A local attacker could
use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). (CVE-2021-3669)

It was discovered that an out-of-bounds write vulnerability existed in the
Video for Linux 2 (V4L2) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-20369)

Pawan Kumar Gupta, Alyssa Milburn, Amit Peled, Shani Rehana, Nir Shildan
and Ariel Sabba discovered that some Intel processors with Enhanced
Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (eIBRS) did not properly handle RET
instructions after a VM exits. A local attacker could potentially use this
to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-26373)

David Leadbeater discovered that the netfilter IRC protocol tracking
implementation in the Linux Kernel incorrectly handled certain message
payloads in some situations. A remote attacker could possibly use this to
cause a denial of service or bypass firewall filtering. (CVE-2022-2663)

Johannes Wikner and Kaveh Razavi discovered that for some AMD x86-64
processors, the branch predictor could by mis-trained for return
instructions in certain circumstances. A local attacker could possibly use
this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2022-29900)

Johannes Wikner and Kaveh Razavi discovered that for some Intel x86-64
processors, the Linux kernel's protections against speculative branch
target injection attacks were insufficient in some circumstances. A local
attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.
(CVE-2022-29901)

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the SGI
GRU driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to
cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
code. (CVE-2022-3424)

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Kernel Connection
Multiplexor (KCM) socket implementation in the Linux kernel when releasing
sockets in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a
denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-3521)

It was discovered that the Netronome Ethernet driver in the Linux kernel
contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this
to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
code. (CVE-2022-3545)

It was discovered that the Broadcom FullMAC USB WiFi driver in the Linux
kernel did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
