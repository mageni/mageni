CVE-2014-8128

William Robinet discovered that out-of-bounds writes are triggered in several of the LibTIFF utilities when processing crafted TIFF files. Other applications using LibTIFF are also likely to be affected in the same way.

CVE-2014-8129

William Robinet discovered that out-of-bounds reads and writes are triggered in tiff2pdf when processing crafted TIFF files. Other applications using LibTIFF are also likely to be affected in the same way.

CVE-2014-9330

Paris Zoumpouloglou discovered that out-of-bounds reads and writes are triggered in bmp2tiff when processing crafted BMP files.

CVE-2014-9655

Michal Zalewski discovered that out-of-bounds reads and writes are triggered in LibTIFF when processing crafted TIFF files.

For the oldoldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in version 3.9.4-5+squeeze12.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed soon.

The stable distribution (jessie) was not affected by these problems as they were fixed before release.");
