CVE-2010-3872

A stack overflow could allow an untrusted FCGI application to cause a server crash or possibly to execute arbitrary code as the user running the web server.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in version 2.2-1+lenny1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), and the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in version 2.3.6-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libapache2-mod-fcgid packages.
