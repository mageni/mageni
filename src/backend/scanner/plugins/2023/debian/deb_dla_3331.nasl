  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"It was discovered that there was a regression in the previous fix for python-cryptography, a Python library offering a number of encryption and cryptography primitives.

The original issue was that there was a potential memory corrution vulnerability. However, the change introduced a regression due to incorrectly backporting upstream's patch to the (older) version in Debian LTS.

CVE-2023-23931

cryptography is a package designed to expose cryptographic primitives and recipes to Python developers. In affected versions `Cipher.update_into` would accept Python objects which implement the buffer protocol, but provide only immutable buffers. This would allow immutable objects (such as `bytes`) to be mutated, thus violating fundamental rules of Python and resulting in corrupted output. This now correctly raises an exception. This issue has been present since `update_into` was originally introduced in cryptography 1.8.

For Debian 10 Buster, this problem has been fixed in version 2.6.1-3+deb10u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-cryptography packages.
