CVE-2016-9602

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the VirtFS, host directory sharing via Plan 9 File System(9pfs) support, is vulnerable to an improper link following issue. It could occur while accessing symbolic link files on a shared host directory.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to access host file system beyond the shared folder and potentially escalating their privileges on a host.

CVE-2017-7377

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the virtio-9p back-end support is vulnerable to a memory leakage issue. It could occur while doing a I/O operation via v9fs_create/v9fs_lcreate routine.

A privileged user/process inside guest could use this flaw to leak host memory resulting in Dos.

CVE-2017-7471

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the VirtFS, host directory sharing via Plan 9 File System(9pfs) support, is vulnerable to an improper access control issue. It could occur while accessing files on a shared host directory.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to access host file system beyond the shared folder and potentially escalating their privileges on a host.

CVE-2017-7493

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the VirtFS, host directory sharing via Plan 9 File System(9pfs) support, is vulnerable to an improper access control issue. It could occur while accessing virtfs metadata files in mapped-file security mode.

A guest user could use this flaw to escalate their privileges inside guest.

CVE-2017-8086

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the virtio-9p back-end support is vulnerable to a memory leakage issue. It could occur while querying file system extended attributes via 9pfs_list_xattr() routine.

A privileged user/process inside guest could use this flaw to leak host memory resulting in Dos.

For Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version 1.1.2+dfsg-6+deb7u22.

We recommend that you upgrade your qemu-kvm packages.
