CVE-2014-7912

The get_option function does not validate the relationship between length fields and the amount of data, which allows remote DHCP servers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a large length value of an option in a DHCPACK message.

CVE-2014-7913

The print_option function misinterprets the return value of the snprintf function, which allows remote DHCP servers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a crafted message.

For Debian 7 Wheezy, these problems have been fixed in version 5.5.6-1+deb7u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your dhcpcd5 packages.
