This issue could enable a remote attacker to crash a Tor client, hidden service, relay, or authority. This update aims to defend against this general class of security bugs.

For Debian 7 Wheezy, this problem has been fixed in version 0.2.4.27-2.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in version 0.2.5.12-3., for unstable (sid) with version 0.2.8.9-1, and for experimental with 0.2.9.4-alpha-1.

Additionally, for wheezy this updates the set of authority directory servers to the one from Tor 0.2.8.7, released in August 2016.

We recommend that you upgrade your tor packages.
