  * A flaw was found in the way Linux kernel's Transparent Huge Pages (THP)
implementation handled non-huge page migration. A local, unprivileged user
could use this flaw to crash the kernel by migrating transparent hugepages.
(CVE-2014-3940, Moderate)

  * A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's eCryptfs
implementation decoded encrypted file names. A local, unprivileged user
could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their
privileges on the system. (CVE-2014-9683, Moderate)

  * A race condition flaw was found between the chown and execve system
calls. When changing the owner of a setuid user binary to root, the race
condition could momentarily make the binary setuid root. A local,
unprivileged user could potentially use this flaw to escalate their
privileges on the system. (CVE-2015-3339, Moderate)

  * Multiple out-of-bounds write flaws were found in the way the Cherry
Cymotion keyboard driver, KYE/Genius device drivers, Logitech device
drivers, Monterey Genius KB29E keyboard driver, Petalynx Maxter remote
control driver, and Sunplus wireless desktop driver handled HID reports
with an invalid report descriptor size. An attacker with physical access to
the system could use either of these flaws to write data past an allocated
memory buffer. (CVE-2014-3184, Low)

  * An information leak flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Advanced
Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) implementation handled access of the user
control's state. A local, privileged user could use this flaw to leak
kernel memory to user space. (CVE-2014-4652, Low)

  * It was found that the espfix functionality could be bypassed by
installing a 16-bit RW data segment into GDT instead of LDT (which espfix
checks), and using that segment on the stack. A local, unprivileged user
could potentially use this flaw to leak kernel stack addresses.
(CVE-2014-8133, Low)

  * An information leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel's IEEE 802.11
wireless networking implementation. When software encryption was used, a
remote attacker could use this flaw to leak up to 8 bytes of plaintext.
(CVE-2014-8709, Low)

  * It was found that the Linux kernel KVM subsystem's sysenter instruction
emulation was not sufficient. An unprivileged guest user could use this
flaw to escalate their privileges by tricking the hypervisor to emulate a
SYSENTER instruction in 16-bit mode, if the guest OS did not initialize the
SYSENTER m ...
