Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed content. Malicious
content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-1718,
CVE-2013-1722, CVE-2013-1725, CVE-2013-1730, CVE-2013-1732, CVE-2013-1735,
CVE-2013-1736)

A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handled certain DOM JavaScript
objects. An attacker could use this flaw to make JavaScript client or
add-on code make incorrect, security sensitive decisions. (CVE-2013-1737)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these
issues. Upstream acknowledges Andr Bargull, Scoobidiver, Bobby Holley,
Reuben Morais, Abhishek Arya, Ms2ger, Sachin Shinde, Aki Helin, Nils, and
Boris Zbarsky as the original reporters of these issues.

Note: All of the above issues cannot be exploited by a specially-crafted
HTML mail message as JavaScript is disabled by default for mail messages.
They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for example, when
viewing the full remote content of an RSS feed.

All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains Thunderbird version 17.0.9 ESR, which corrects these issues. After
installing the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes to
take effect.");
