  implementation of Java Web Start, which is based on the Netx project. It
  also contains a configuration tool for managing deployment settings for the
  plug-in and Web Start implementations.

  It was discovered that the IcedTea-Web plug-in incorrectly used the same
  class loader instance for applets with the same value of the codebase
  attribute, even when they originated from different domains. A malicious
  applet could use this flaw to gain information about and possibly
  manipulate applets from different domains currently running in the browser.
  (CVE-2013-1926)

  The IcedTea-Web plug-in did not properly check the format of the downloaded
  Java Archive (JAR) files. This could cause the plug-in to execute code
  hidden in a file in a different format, possibly allowing attackers to
  execute code in the context of web sites that allow uploads of specific
  file types, known as a GIFAR attack. (CVE-2013-1927)

  The CVE-2013-1926 issue was discovered by Jiri Vanek of the Red Hat OpenJDK
  Team, and CVE-2013-1927 was discovered by the Red Hat Security Response
  Team.

  This erratum also upgrades IcedTea-Web to version 1.2.3. Refer to the NEWS
  file, linked to in the References, for further information.

  All IcedTea-Web users should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  resolve these issues. Web browsers using the IcedTea-Web browser plug-in
  must be restarted for this update to take effect.");
