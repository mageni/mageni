Multiple heap-based buffer overflow flaws were found in OpenJPEG.
An attacker could create a specially crafted OpenJPEG image that, when
opened, could cause an application using openjpeg to crash or, possibly,
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application. (CVE-2013-6045, CVE-2013-6054)

Multiple denial of service flaws were found in OpenJPEG. An attacker could
create a specially crafted OpenJPEG image that, when opened, could cause an
application using openjpeg to crash (CVE-2013-1447, CVE-2013-6052)

Red Hat would like to thank Raphael Geissert for reporting these issues.
