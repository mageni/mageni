  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"The Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments (SPICE) is a
remote display protocol for virtual environments. SPICE users can access a
virtualized desktop or server from the local system or any system with
network access to the server. SPICE is used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux for
viewing virtualized guests running on the Kernel-based Virtual Machine
(KVM) hypervisor or on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisors.

A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the
reds_handle_ticket() function in the spice-server library handled
decryption of ticket data provided by the client. A remote user able to
initiate a SPICE connection to an application acting as a SPICE server
could use this flaw to crash the application. (CVE-2013-4282)

This issue was discovered by Tomas Jamrisko of Red Hat.

which contains a backported patch to correct this issue.");
