  A flaw was found in the way the tomcat6 init script handled the
  tomcat6-initd.log log file. A malicious web application deployed on Tomcat
  could use this flaw to perform a symbolic link attack to change the
  ownership of an arbitrary system file to that of the tomcat user, allowing
  them to escalate their privileges to root. (CVE-2013-1976)

  Note: With this update, tomcat6-initd.log has been moved from
  /var/log/tomcat6/ to the /var/log/ directory.

  It was found that the RHSA-2013:0623 update did not correctly fix
  CVE-2012-5887, a weakness in the Tomcat DIGEST authentication
  implementation. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform replay
  attacks in some circumstances. Additionally, this problem also prevented
  users from being able to authenticate using DIGEST authentication.
  (CVE-2013-2051)

  Red Hat would like to thank Simon Fayer of Imperial College London for
  reporting the CVE-2013-1976 issue.

  Users of Tomcat are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct these issues. Tomcat must be restarted for this update to take
  effect.");
