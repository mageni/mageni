Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed content. Malicious
content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-5590,
CVE-2013-5597, CVE-2013-5599, CVE-2013-5600, CVE-2013-5601, CVE-2013-5602)

It was found that the Thunderbird JavaScript engine incorrectly allocated
memory for certain functions. An attacker could combine this flaw with
other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-5595)

A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handled certain Extensible
Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) files. An attacker could combine
this flaw with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-5604)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these
issues. Upstream acknowledges Jesse Ruderman, Christoph Diehl, Dan Gohman,
Byoungyoung Lee, Nils, and Abhishek Arya as the original reporters of these
issues.

Note: All of the above issues cannot be exploited by a specially-crafted
HTML mail message as JavaScript is disabled by default for mail messages.
They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for example, when
viewing the full remote content of an RSS feed.

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Thunderbird 17.0.10 ESR. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section of this erratum.

All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains Thunderbird version 17.0.10 ESR, which corrects these issues.

to take effect.");
