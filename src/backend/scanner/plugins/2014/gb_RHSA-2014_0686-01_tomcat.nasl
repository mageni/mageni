It was found that a fix for a previous security flaw introduced a
regression that could cause a denial of service in Tomcat 7. A remote
attacker could use this flaw to consume an excessive amount of CPU on the
Tomcat server by sending a specially crafted request to that server.
(CVE-2014-0186)

It was found that when Tomcat 7 processed a series of HTTP requests in
which at least one request contained either multiple content-length
headers, or one content-length header with a chunked transfer-encoding
header, Tomcat would incorrectly handle the request. A remote attacker
could use this flaw to poison a web cache, perform cross-site scripting
(XSS) attacks, or obtain sensitive information from other requests.
(CVE-2013-4286)

It was discovered that the fix for CVE-2012-3544 did not properly resolve a
denial of service flaw in the way Tomcat 7 processed chunk extensions and
trailing headers in chunked requests. A remote attacker could use this flaw
to send an excessively long request that, when processed by Tomcat, could
consume network bandwidth, CPU, and memory on the Tomcat server. Note that
chunked transfer encoding is enabled by default. (CVE-2013-4322)

contain backported patches to correct these issues. Tomcat must be
