  script_tag(name:"affected", value:"openssl on Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server (v. 7)");

  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
  and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

It was found that OpenSSL clients and servers could be forced, via a
specially crafted handshake packet, to use weak keying material for
communication. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to decrypt
and modify traffic between a client and a server. (CVE-2014-0224)

Note: In order to exploit this flaw, both the server and the client must be
using a vulnerable version of OpenSSL  the server must be using OpenSSL
version 1.0.1 and above, and the client must be using any version of
OpenSSL. For more information about this flaw, buffer overflow flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled invalid DTLS
packet fragments. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to execute
arbitrary code on a DTLS client or server. (CVE-2014-0195)

Multiple flaws were found in the way OpenSSL handled read and write buffers
when the SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS mode was enabled. A TLS/SSL client or
server using OpenSSL could crash or unexpectedly drop connections when
processing certain SSL traffic. (CVE-2010-5298, CVE-2014-0198)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled certain DTLS
ServerHello requests. A specially crafted DTLS handshake packet could cause
a DTLS client using OpenSSL to crash. (CVE-2014-0221)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way OpenSSL performed
anonymous Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH) key exchange. A specially
crafted handshake packet could cause a TLS/SSL client that has the
anonymous ECDH cipher suite enabled to crash. (CVE-2014-3470)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges KIKUCHI Masashi of Lepidum as the original reporter
of CVE-2014-0224, Jri Aedla as the original reporter of CVE-2014-0195,
Imre Rad of Search-Lab as the original reporter of CVE-2014-0221, and Felix
Grbert and Ivan Fratri of Google as the original reporters of
CVE-2014-3470.

All OpenSSL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. For the update to take
effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library (such as httpd and other
SSL-enabled services) must be restarted or the system rebooted.
