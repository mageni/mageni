subsystem that allows normal users to enable function tracing. An
unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially
sensitive information from the kernel. (CVE-2013-2930)

Stephan Mueller reported an error in the Linux kernel's ansi cprng random
number generator. This flaw makes it easier for a local attacker to break
cryptographic protections. (CVE-2013-4345)

Multiple integer overflow flaws were discovered in the Alchemy LCD frame-
buffer drivers in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could
exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2013-4511)

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a buffer overflow in the Ozmo
Devices USB over WiFi devices. A local user could exploit this flaw to
cause a denial of service or possibly unspecified impact. (CVE-2013-4513)

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's
driver for Agere Systems HERMES II Wireless PC Cards. A local user with the
CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of
service or possibly gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2013-4514)

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's
driver for Beceem WIMAX chipset based devices. An unprivileged local user
could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.
(CVE-2013-4515)

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's compat ioctls for Adaptec
AACRAID scsi raid devices. An unprivileged local user could send
administrative commands to these devices potentially compromising the data
stored on the device. (CVE-2013-6383)

Nico Golde reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's userspace IO (uio) driver.
A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory
corruption) or possibly gain privileges. (CVE-2013-6763)

Evan Huus reported a buffer overflow in the Linux kernel's radiotap header
parsing. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (buffer over-
read) via a specially crafted header. (CVE-2013-7027)");
