  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"WEBrick::HTTPAuth::DigestAuth in Ruby through 2.4.7, 2.5.x through 2.5.6, and 2.6.x through 2.6.4 has a regular expression Denial of Service cause by looping/backtracking. A victim must expose a WEBrick server that uses DigestAuth to the Internet or a untrusted network.(CVE-2019-16201)

Ruby through 2.4.7, 2.5.x through 2.5.6, and 2.6.x through 2.6.4 allows HTTP Response Splitting. If a program using WEBrick inserts untrusted input into the response header, an attacker can exploit it to insert a newline character to split a header, and inject malicious content to deceive clients. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2017-17742, which addressed the CRLF vector, but did not address an isolated CR or an isolated LF.(CVE-2019-16254)

Ruby through 2.4.7, 2.5.x through 2.5.6, and 2.6.x through 2.6.4 mishandles path checking within File.fnmatch functions.(CVE-2019-15845)

Ruby through 2.4.7, 2.5.x through 2.5.6, and 2.6.x through 2.6.4 allows code injection if the first argument (aka the 'command' argument) to Shell#[] or Shell#test in lib/shell.rb is untrusted data. An attacker can exploit this to call an arbitrary Ruby method.(CVE-2019-16255)

The JSON gem through 2.2.0 for Ruby, as used in Ruby 2.4 through 2.4.9, 2.5 through 2.5.7, and 2.6 through 2.6.5, has an Unsafe Object Creation Vulnerability. This is quite similar to CVE-2013-0269, but does not rely on poor garbage-collection behavior within Ruby. Specifically, use of JSON parsing methods can lead to creation of a malicious object within the interpreter, with adverse effects that are application-dependent.(CVE-2020-10663)");
