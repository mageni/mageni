A man in the middle attacker could use this flaw to intercept the request to the KDC and replace the user name (principal) in the request with any desired user name (principal) that exists in the KDC effectively obtaining a ticket for that principal.(CVE-2018-16860)

A use-after-free flaw was found in the way samba AD DC LDAP servers, handled 'Paged Results' control is combined with the 'ASQ' control. A malicious user in a samba AD could use this flaw to cause denial of service. This issue affects all samba versions before 4.10.15, before 4.11.8 and before 4.12.2.(CVE-2020-10700)

A flaw was found in the AD DC NBT server in all Samba versions before 4.10.17, before 4.11.11 and before 4.12.4. A samba user could send an empty UDP packet to cause the samba server to crash.(CVE-2020-14303)

A NULL pointer dereference, or possible use-after-free flaw was found in the Samba AD LDAP server. Although some versions of Samba shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux do not support Samba in AD mode, the affected code is shipped with the libldb package. This flaw allows an authenticated user to possibly trigger a use-after-free or NULL pointer dereference. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.(CVE-2020-10730)

A flaw was found in Samba in the way it processed NetBios over TCP/IP. This flaw allows a remote attacker could to cause the Samba server to consume excessive CPU use, resulting in a denial of service. This highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.(CVE-2020-10745)

A use-after-free flaw was found in all samba LDAP server versions before 4.10.17, before 4.11.11, before 4.12.4 used in a AC DC configuration. A Samba LDAP user could use this flaw to crash samba.(CVE-2020-10760)");
