An issue was discovered in GNU libiberty, as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.32. It is a stack consumption issue in d_count_templates_scopes in cp-demangle.c after many recursive calls.(CVE-2019-9071)

An issue was discovered in GNU libiberty, as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.32. simple_object_elf_match in simple-object-elf.c does not check for a zero shstrndx value, leading to an integer overflow and resultant heap-based buffer overflow.(CVE-2019-14250)

GNU gdb All versions is affected by: Buffer Overflow - Out of bound memory access. The impact is: Deny of Service, Memory Disclosure, and Possible Code Execution. The component is: The main gdb module. The attack vector is: Open an ELF for debugging. The fixed version is: Not fixed yet.(CVE-2019-1010180)

An issue was discovered in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.32. It is an integer overflow leading to a SEGV in _bfd_dwarf2_find_nearest_line in dwarf2.c, as demonstrated by nm.(CVE-2019-17451)

An issue was discovered in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.32. It is an attempted excessive memory allocation in _bfd_elf_slurp_version_tables in elf.c.(CVE-2019-9073)

apply_relocations in readelf.c in GNU Binutils 2.32 contains an integer overflow that allows attackers to trigger a write access violation (in byte_put_little_endian function in elfcomm.c) via an ELF file, as demonstrated by readelf.(CVE-2019-14444)

remember_Ktype in cplus-dem.c in GNU libiberty, as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.30, allows attackers to trigger excessive memory consumption (aka OOM). This can occur during execution of cxxfilt.(CVE-2018-12934)");
