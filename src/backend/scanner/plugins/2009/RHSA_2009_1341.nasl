tag_summary = "The remote host is missing updates announced in
advisory RHSA-2009:1341.

The Cluster Manager (cman) utility provides services for managing a Linux
cluster.

Multiple insecure temporary file use flaws were found in fence_apc_snmp and
ccs_tool. A local attacker could use these flaws to overwrite an arbitrary
file writable by a victim running those utilities (typically root) with
the output of the utilities via a symbolic link attack. (CVE-2008-4579,
CVE-2008-6552)

Users of cman are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
resolve these issues.";
