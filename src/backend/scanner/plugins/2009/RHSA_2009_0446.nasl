tag_summary = "The remote host is missing updates announced in
advisory RHSA-2009:0446.

mod_jk is an Apache Tomcat connector that allows Apache Tomcat and the
Apache HTTP Server to communicate with each other.

An information disclosure flaw was found in mod_jk. In certain situations,
if a faulty client set the Content-Length header without providing data,
or if a user sent repeated requests very quickly, one user may view a
response intended for another user. (CVE-2008-5519)

As well, the sample configuration files provided in the documentation have
been updated to reflect recommended practice.

All mod_jk users are advised to upgrade to this updated package. It
provides mod_jk 1.2.28, which is not vulnerable to this issue.";

tag_solution = "Please note that this update is available via
Red Hat Network.  To use Red Hat Network, launch the Red
Hat Update Agent with the following command: up2date";
