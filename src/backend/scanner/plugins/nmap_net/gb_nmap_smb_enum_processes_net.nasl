  script_tag(name:"summary", value:"Pulls a list of processes from the remote server over SMB. This will determine all running
processes, their process IDs, and their parent processes. It is done by querying the remote registry
service, which is disabled by default on Vista. On all other Windows versions, it requires
Administrator privileges.

Since this requires administrator privileges, it isn't especially useful for a penetration tester,
since they can effectively do the same thing with metasploit or other tools. It does, however,
provide for a quick way to get process lists for a bunch of systems at the same time.

WARNING: I have experienced crashes in 'regsvc.exe' while making registry calls against a
fully patched Windows 2000 system. I've fixed the issue that caused it, but there's no guarantee
that it (or a similar vulnerability in the same code) won't show up again. Since the process
automatically restarts, it doesn't negatively impact the system, besides showing a message box to
the user.

SYNTAX:

smbbasic:     Forces the authentication to use basic security, as opposed to 'extended security'.
Against most modern systems, extended security should work, but there may be cases
where you want to force basic. There's a chance that you'll get better results for
enumerating users if you turn on basic authentication.

smbport:       Override the default port choice. If 'smbport' is open, it's used. It's assumed
to be the same protocol as port 445, not port 139. Since it probably isn't possible to change
Windows' ports normally, this is mostly useful if you're bouncing through a relay or something.

smbsign:       Controls whether or not server signatures are checked in SMB packets. By default, on Windows,
server signatures aren't enabled or required. By default, this library will always sign
packets if it knows how, and will check signatures if the server says to. Possible values are:

  - 'force':      Always check server signatures, even if server says it doesn't support them (will
probably fail, but is technically more secure).

  - 'negotiate': [default] Use signatures if server supports them.

  - 'ignore':    Never check server signatures. Not recommended.

  - 'disable':   Don't send signatures, at all, and don't check the server's. not recommended.
More information on signatures can be found in 'smbauth.lua'.

randomseed:    Set to a value to change the filenames/service names that are randomly generated.");
