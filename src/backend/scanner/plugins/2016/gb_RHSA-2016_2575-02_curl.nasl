library and the curl utility for downloading files from servers using various
protocols, including HTTP, FTP, and LDAP.

Security Fix(es):

  * It was found that the libcurl library did not prevent TLS session
resumption when the client certificate had changed. An attacker could
potentially use this flaw to hijack the authentication of the connection by
leveraging a previously created connection with a different client
certificate. (CVE-2016-5419)

  * It was found that the libcurl library did not check the client
certificate when choosing the TLS connection to reuse. An attacker could
potentially use this flaw to hijack the authentication of the connection by
leveraging a previously created connection with a different client
certificate. (CVE-2016-5420)

  * It was found that the libcurl library using the NSS (Network Security
Services) library as TLS/SSL backend incorrectly re-used client
certificates for subsequent TLS connections in certain cases. An attacker
could potentially use this flaw to hijack the authentication of the
connection by leveraging a previously created connection with a different
client certificate. (CVE-2016-7141)
