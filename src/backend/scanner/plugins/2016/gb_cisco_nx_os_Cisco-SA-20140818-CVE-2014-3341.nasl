  script_tag(name:"summary", value:"A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) module of Cisco NX-OS Software
could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information.

The vulnerability is due to a failure to respond to invalid requests in the same manner when
specifying a VLAN ID. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by making a large number of
requests to the listening SNMP port of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the
attacker to enumerate VLANs that are configured on the affected device.

This vulnerability affects Cisco Nexus 5000 Series and Cisco Nexus 6000 Series devices running an
affected version of Cisco NX-OS Software.

Cisco would like to thank Ehab Hussein of IOActive for discovering and reporting this vulnerability.

Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.


To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may need access to trusted, internal networks behind a
firewall to make a large number of request to the targeted device. This access requirement may
reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit. In addition, the attacker may need to obtain
additional information such as whether SNMP and VLAN IDs are configured on the device prior to
attempting to exploit this vulnerability.

Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists. However, the code is not
known to be publicly available.");
