sections and (lists of) values (strings, integers, floats,

as single/double-quoted strings, environment variable expansion,
functions and nested include statements). It makes it very
easy to add configuration file capability to a program using
a simple API.

library with a gazillion of features. Instead, it aims to be
easy to use and quick to integrate with your code.");
