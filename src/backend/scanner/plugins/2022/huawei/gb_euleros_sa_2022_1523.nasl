  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.(CVE-2022-0492)

An out of memory bounds write flaw (1 or 2 bytes of memory) in the Linux kernel NFS subsystem was found in the way users use mirroring (replication of files with NFS). A user, having access to the NFS mount, could potentially use this flaw to crash the system or escalate privileges on the system.(CVE-2021-4157)

Improper input validation in the Intel(R) Ethernet ixgbe driver for Linux before version 3.17.3 may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.(CVE-2021-33098)

In gadget_dev_desc_UDC_show of configfs.c, there is a possible disclosure of kernel heap memory due to a race condition. This could lead to local information disclosure with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.(CVE-2021-39648)

A vulnerability was found in the fs/inode.c:inode_init_owner() function logic of the LInux kernel that allows local users to create files for the XFS file-system with an unintended group ownership and with group execution and SGID permission bits set, in a scenario where a directory is SGID and belongs to a certain group and is writable by a user who is not a member of this group. This can lead to excessive permissions granted in case when they should not. This vulnerability is similar to the previous CVE-2018-13405 and adds the missed fix for the XFS.(CVE-2021-4037)

A data leak flaw was found in the way XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP IOCTL in the XFS filesystem allowed for size increase of files with unaligned size. A local attacker could use this flaw to leak data on the XFS filesystem otherwise not accessible to them.(CVE-2021-4155)");
