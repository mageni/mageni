This flaw allows a privileged guest user to hang the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service.(CVE-2020-14394)

A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the LSI53C895A SCSI Host Bus Adapter emulation of QEMU. The flaw occurs while processing repeated messages to cancel the current SCSI request via the lsi_do_msgout function. This flaw allows a malicious privileged user within the guest to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service.(CVE-2022-0216)

A DMA reentrancy issue was found in the NVM Express Controller (NVME) emulation in QEMU. This CVE is similar to CVE-2021-3750 and, just like it, when the reentrancy write triggers the reset function nvme_ctrl_reset(), data structs will be freed leading to a use-after-free issue. A malicious guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition or, potentially, executing arbitrary code within the context of the QEMU process on the host.(CVE-2021-3929)");
