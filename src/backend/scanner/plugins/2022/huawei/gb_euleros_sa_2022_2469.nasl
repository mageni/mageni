An attacker who supplies a crafted file to tiffcrop could trigger this flaw, most likely by tricking a user into opening the crafted file with tiffcrop. Triggering this flaw could cause a crash or potentially further exploitation.(CVE-2022-2869)

A stack overflow was discovered in the _TIFFVGetField function of Tiffsplit v4.4.0. This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted TIFF file.(CVE-2022-34526)

Divide By Zero error in tiffcrop in libtiff 4.4.0 allows attackers to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted tiff file. For users that compile libtiff from sources, the fix is available with commit f3a5e010.(CVE-2022-2057)
