  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.11. The netfilter subsystem allows attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) because net/netfilter/x_tables.c and include/linux/netfilter/x_tables.h lack a full memory barrier upon the assignment of a new table value, aka CID-175e476b8cdf.(CVE-2021-29650)

A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function that allows an attacker to cause a denial of service. The vulnerability is similar to the older CVE-2019-18808. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.(CVE-2021-3764)

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A memory leak in the ccp-ops crypto driver can allow attackers to cause a denial of service. This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.(CVE-2021-3744)

In the Linux kernel through 5.13.7, an unprivileged BPF program can obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a Speculative Store Bypass side-channel attack because the protection mechanism neglects the possibility of uninitialized memory locations on the BPF stack.(CVE-2021-34556)

In the Linux kernel through 5.13.7, an unprivileged BPF program can obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a Speculative Store Bypass side-channel attack because a certain preempting store operation does not necessarily occur before a store operation that has an attacker-controlled value.(CVE-2021-35477)

A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel. Missing size validations on inbound SCTP packets may allow the kernel to read uninitialized memory.(CVE-2021-3655)

In memzero_explicit of compiler-clang.h, there is a possible bypass of defense in depth due to uninitialized data. This could lead to local information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-171418586References: Upstream kernel(CVE-2021-0938)

A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.(CVE-2021-20321)

A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in Google Android (Smartphone Operating System) (unknown version). This issue affects an unknown function of the component Kernel. Impacted is confidentiality, integrity, and availability.(CVE-2021-0920)

Improper input validation in the Intel(R) Ethernet ixgbe driver for Linux before version 3.17.3 may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.(CVE-2021-33098)

In bpf_skb_change_head of filter.c, there is a possible out of bounds read due to a use after free. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
