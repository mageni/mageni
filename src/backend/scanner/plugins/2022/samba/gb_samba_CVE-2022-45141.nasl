  This key needs to be of a type understood only by the KDC and target server.

  However, due to a coding error subsequently addressed in all recent Heimdal versions and so fixed
  with Samba 4.16 (which imports Heimdal 8.0pre), the (attacking) client would be given the
  opportunity to select the encryption type, and so obtain a ticket encrypted with rc4-hmac, that it
  could attack offline.

  This is possible unless rc4-hmac is totally removed from the server's account, by removing the
  unicodePwd attribute, but this will break other aspects of the server's operation in the domain
  (NETLOGON in particular).");
