allocations for anonymous VMA mappings in some situations, leading to
potential data structure reuse. A local attacker could use this to cause a
denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2022-42703)

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the memory address space
accounting implementation in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free
vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-41222)

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the instruction emulator
of the Linux kernel on Arm 64-bit systems. A local attacker could use this
to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-20422)

It was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not
properly handle virtual CPUs without APICs in certain situations. A local
attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (host system
crash). (CVE-2022-2153)

Hao Sun and Jiacheng Xu discovered that the NILFS file system
implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free
vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-2978)

Johannes Wikner and Kaveh Razavi discovered that for some Intel x86-64
processors, the Linux kernel's protections against speculative branch
target injection attacks were insufficient in some circumstances. A local
attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.
(CVE-2022-29901)

Abhishek Shah discovered a race condition in the PF_KEYv2 implementation in
the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel
memory). (CVE-2022-3028)

It was discovered that the Netlink device interface implementation in the
Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a
use-after-free vulnerability with some network device drivers. A local
attacker with admin access to the network device could use this to cause a
denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2022-3625)

It was discovered that the IDT 77252 ATM PCI device driver in the Linux
kernel did not properly remove any pending timers during device exit,
resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could
possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-3635)

Jann Horn discovered a race condition existed in the Linux kernel when
unmapping VMAs in certain situations, resulting in possible use-after-free
vulnerabilities. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial
of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-39188)
