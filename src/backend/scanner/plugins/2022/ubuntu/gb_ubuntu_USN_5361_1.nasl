Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel's WiFi implementation did
not properly verify certain fragmented frames. A physically proximate
attacker could possibly use this issue to inject or decrypt packets.
(CVE-2020-26141)

Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel's WiFi implementation
accepted plaintext fragments in certain situations. A physically proximate
attacker could use this issue to inject packets. (CVE-2020-26145)

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Atheros Ath9k WiFi
driver in the Linux kernel. An attacker could possibly use this to expose
sensitive information (WiFi network traffic). (CVE-2020-3702)

It was discovered a race condition existed in the Unix domain socket
implementation in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free
vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-0920)

It was discovered that the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel
contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this
to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
code. (CVE-2021-0935)

Zygo Blaxell discovered that the btrfs file system implementation in the
Linux kernel contained a race condition during certain cloning operations.
A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash). (CVE-2021-28964)

Dan Carpenter discovered that the block device manager (dm) implementation
in the Linux kernel contained a buffer overflow in the ioctl for listing
devices. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service (system crash). (CVE-2021-31916)

It was discovered that the Option USB High Speed Mobile device driver in
the Linux kernel did not properly handle error conditions. A physically
proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system
crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-37159)

It was discovered that the network packet filtering implementation in the
Linux kernel did not properly initialize information in certain
circumstances. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive
information (kernel memory). (CVE-2021-39636)

Jann Horn discovered a race condition in the Unix domain socket
implementation in the Linux kernel that could result in a read-after-free.
A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)
or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-4083)

Luo Likang discovered that the FireDTV Firewire driver in the Linux kernel
did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. A local
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
