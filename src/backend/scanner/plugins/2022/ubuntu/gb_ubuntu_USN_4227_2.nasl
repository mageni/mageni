18.04 LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the
Linux kernel for Microsoft Azure Cloud systems for Ubuntu 14.04 ESM.

It was discovered that a heap-based buffer overflow existed in the Marvell
WiFi-Ex Driver for the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could
use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-14895, CVE-2019-14901)

It was discovered that a heap-based buffer overflow existed in the Marvell
Libertas WLAN Driver for the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker
could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly
execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-14896, CVE-2019-14897)

It was discovered that the Fujitsu ES network device driver for the Linux
kernel did not properly check for errors in some situations, leading to a
NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial
of service. (CVE-2019-16231)

It was discovered that the QLogic Fibre Channel driver in the Linux kernel
did not properly check for error, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. A
local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system
crash). (CVE-2019-16233)

Anthony Steinhauser discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly
perform Spectre_RSB mitigations to all processors for PowerPC architecture
systems in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose
sensitive information. (CVE-2019-18660)

It was discovered that the Mellanox Technologies Innova driver in the Linux
kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain failure conditions. A
local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory
exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19045)

It was discovered that Geschwister Schneider USB CAN interface driver in
the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain failure
conditions. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a
denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19052)

It was discovered that the AMD Display Engine Driver in the Linux kernel
did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local
attack could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).
(CVE-2019-19083)

It was discovered that the driver for memoryless force-feedback input
devices in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A
physically proximate attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of
service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-19524)

It was discovered that the Microchip CAN BUS Analyzer driver in the Linux
kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability on device disconnect. A
physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-19529)
