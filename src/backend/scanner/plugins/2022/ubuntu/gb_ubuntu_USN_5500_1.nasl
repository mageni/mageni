in the Linux kernel did not perform permission checks correctly in some
situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain administrative
privileges. (CVE-2021-4197)

Lin Ma discovered that the NFC Controller Interface (NCI) implementation in
the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free
vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-4202)

It was discovered that the PF_KEYv2 implementation in the Linux kernel did
not properly initialize kernel memory in some situations. A local attacker
could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).
(CVE-2022-1353)

It was discovered that the virtual graphics memory manager implementation
in the Linux kernel was subject to a race condition, potentially leading to
an information leak. (CVE-2022-1419)

Minh Yuan discovered that the floppy disk driver in the Linux kernel
contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A
local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system
crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1652)

It was discovered that the Atheros ath9k wireless device driver in the
Linux kernel did not properly handle some error conditions, leading to a
use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a
denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

It was discovered that the Marvell NFC device driver implementation in the
Linux kernel did not properly perform memory cleanup operations in some
situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker
could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1734)

Zhao Zi Xuan discovered that the 802.2 LLC type 2 driver in the Linux kernel did not
properly perform reference counting in some error conditions. A local
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-28356)");
