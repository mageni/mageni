Duoming Zhou discovered that race conditions existed in the timer handling
implementation of the Linux kernel's Rose X.25 protocol layer, resulting in
use-after-free vulnerabilities. A local attacker could use this to cause a
denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-2318)

Hao Sun and Jiacheng Xu discovered that the NILFS file system
implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free
vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-2978)

Abhishek Shah discovered a race condition in the PF_KEYv2 implementation in
the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information (kernel
memory). (CVE-2022-3028)

Xingyuan Mo and Gengjia Chen discovered that the Promise SuperTrak EX
storage controller driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle
certain structures. A local attacker could potentially use this to expose
sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2022-40768)

Sonke Huster discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in
the WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel, leading to a buffer overflow. A
physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-41674)

Sonke Huster discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the
WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker
could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly
execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-42719)

Sonke Huster discovered that the WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel did
not properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a
use-after-free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use
this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-42720)

Sonke Huster discovered that the WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel did
not properly handle BSSID/SSID lists in some situations. A physically
proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (infinite
loop). (CVE-2022-42721)

Sonke Huster discovered that the WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel
contained a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in certain situations. A
physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash). (CVE-2022-42722)");
