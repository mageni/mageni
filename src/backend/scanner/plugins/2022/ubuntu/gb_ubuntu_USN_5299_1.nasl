  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"Mathy Vanhoef discovered that the Linux kernel's WiFi implementation could
reassemble mixed encrypted and plaintext fragments. A physically proximate
attacker could possibly use this issue to inject packets or exfiltrate
selected fragments. (CVE-2020-26147)

It was discovered that the bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel did not
properly perform access control. An authenticated attacker could possibly
use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-26558, CVE-2021-0129)

It was discovered that the RPA PCI Hotplug driver implementation in the
Linux kernel did not properly handle device name writes via sysfs, leading
to a buffer overflow. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a
denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2021-28972)

It was discovered that a use-after-free existed in the Bluetooth HCI driver
of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-33034)

Norbert Slusarek discovered that the CAN broadcast manager (bcm) protocol
implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory in
some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive
information (kernel memory). (CVE-2021-34693)

Ma Zhe Yu discovered that the IEEE 1394 (Firewire) nosy packet sniffer driver in
the Linux kernel did not properly perform reference counting in some
situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker
could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly
execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3483)

It was discovered that the bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel did not
properly handle HCI device initialization failure, leading to a double-free
vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or
possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-3564)

Murray McAllister discovered that the joystick device interface in the
Linux kernel did not properly validate data passed via an ioctl(). A local
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
possibly execute arbitrary code on systems with a joystick device
registered. (CVE-2021-3612)

It was discovered that the tracing subsystem in the Linux kernel did not
properly keep track of per-cpu ring buffer state. A privileged attacker
could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2021-3679)

It was discovered that the MAX-3421 host USB device driver in the Linux
kernel did not properly handle device removal events. A physically
proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system
crash). (CVE-2021-38204)

It was discovered that the 6pack network protocol driver in the Linux
kernel did not properly perform validation checks. A privileged attacker
could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-42008)
