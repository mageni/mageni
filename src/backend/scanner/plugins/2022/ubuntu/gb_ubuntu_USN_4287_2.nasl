LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux
kernel for Microsoft Azure Cloud systems for Ubuntu 14.04 ESM.

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly clear data
structures on context switches for certain Intel graphics processors. A
local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.
(CVE-2019-14615)

It was discovered that the Atheros 802.11ac wireless USB device driver in
the Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically
proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system
crash). (CVE-2019-15099)

It was discovered that the HSA Linux kernel driver for AMD GPU devices did
not properly check for errors in certain situations, leading to a NULL
pointer dereference. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service. (CVE-2019-16229)

It was discovered that the Marvell 8xxx Libertas WLAN device driver in the
Linux kernel did not properly check for errors in certain situations,
leading to a NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could possibly use
this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-16232)

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Virtual Video Test
Driver in the Linux kernel. An attacker with write access to /dev/video0 on
a system with the vivid module loaded could possibly use this to gain
administrative privileges. (CVE-2019-18683)

It was discovered that the Renesas Digital Radio Interface (DRIF) driver in
the Linux kernel did not properly initialize data. A local attacker could
possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).
(CVE-2019-18786)

It was discovered that the Afatech AF9005 DVB-T USB device driver in the
Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error
conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of
service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-18809)

It was discovered that the btrfs file system in the Linux kernel did not
properly validate metadata, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. An
attacker could use this to specially craft a file system image that, when
mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-18885)

It was discovered that multiple memory leaks existed in the Marvell WiFi-Ex
Driver for the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to
cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19057)

It was discovered that the crypto subsystem in the Linux kernel did not
properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker
could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).
(CVE-2019-19062)

It was discovered that the Realtek rtlwifi USB device driver in the Linux
kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A
local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
