Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for Ubuntu
12.04 ESM.

It was discovered that the paravirtualization implementation in the Linux
kernel did not properly handle some indirect calls, reducing the
effectiveness of Spectre v2 mitigations for paravirtual guests. A local
attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2018-15594)

It was discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and
prediction of return addresses via Return Stack Buffer (RSB) may allow
unauthorized memory reads via sidechannel attacks. An attacker could use
this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2018-15572)

It was discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in the
Linux kernel when loading an executable to run. A local attacker could use
this to gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2018-14634)

It was discovered that a stack-based buffer overflow existed in the iSCSI
target implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this
to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-14633)

It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the IRDA subsystem of the
Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2018-6554)

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the IRDA
implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to
cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
code. (CVE-2018-6555)");
