  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  SeaMonkey. (CVE-2009-3072, CVE-2009-3075)

  A use-after-free flaw was found in SeaMonkey. An attacker could use this
  flaw to crash SeaMonkey or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2009-3077)

  Dan Kaminsky discovered flaws in the way browsers such as SeaMonkey handle
  NULL characters in a certificate. If an attacker is able to get a
  carefully-crafted certificate signed by a Certificate Authority trusted by
  SeaMonkey, the attacker could use the certificate during a
  man-in-the-middle attack and potentially confuse SeaMonkey into accepting
  it by mistake. (CVE-2009-2408)

  Descriptions in the dialogs when adding and removing PKCS #11 modules were
  not informative. An attacker able to trick a user into installing a
  malicious PKCS #11 module could use this flaw to install their own
  Certificate Authority certificates on a user's machine, making it possible
  to trick the user into believing they are viewing a trusted site or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  SeaMonkey. (CVE-2009-3076)

  A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey displays the address bar when
  window.open() is called in a certain way. An attacker could use this flaw
  to conceal a malicious URL, possibly tricking a user into believing they
  are viewing a trusted site. (CVE-2009-2654)

  Dan Kaminsky found that browsers still accept certificates with MD2 hash
  signatures, even though MD2 is no longer considered a cryptographically
  strong algorithm. This could make it easier for an attacker to create a
  malicious certificate that would be treated as trusted by a browser. NSS
  (provided by SeaMonkey) now disables the use of MD2 and MD4 algorithms
  inside signatures by default. (CVE-2009-2409)

  All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct
  these issues. After installing the update, SeaMonkey must be restarted for
  the changes to take effect.");
