  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol that allows
  individual devices on an IP network to get their own network configuration
  information, including an IP address, a subnet mask, and a broadcast
  address.

  It was discovered that the DHCP client daemon, dhclient, did not
  sufficiently sanitize certain options provided in DHCP server replies, such
  as the client hostname. A malicious DHCP server could send such an option
  with a specially-crafted value to a DHCP client. If this option's value was
  saved on the client system, and then later insecurely evaluated by a
  process that assumes the option is trusted, it could lead to arbitrary code
  execution with the privileges of that process. (CVE-2011-0997)

  Red Hat would like to thank Sebastian Krahmer of the SuSE Security Team for
  reporting this issue.

  a backported patch to correct this issue.");
