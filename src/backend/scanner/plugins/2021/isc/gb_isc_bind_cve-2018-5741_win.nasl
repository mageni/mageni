  Dynamic DNS (DDNS) to update records in a zone, BIND 9 provides a feature called update-policy.
  Various rules can be configured to limit the types of updates that can be performed by a client,
  depending on the key used when sending the update request. Unfortunately, some rule types were
  not initially documented, and when documentation for them was added to the Administrator
  Reference Manual (ARM), the language that was added to the ARM at that time incorrectly described
  the behavior of two rule types, krb5-subdomain and ms-subdomain. This incorrect documentation
  could mislead operators into believing that policies they had configured were more restrictive
  than they actually were.");

  permit updates from any client authenticated with a valid Kerberos or Windows machine principal

  name specified in the name field. The incorrect documentation, however, indicated that the policy
  would be restricted to names at or below the machine's name as encoded in the Windows or Kerberos
