Onigmo through 6.2.0 has an out-of-bounds read in parse_char_class because of missing codepoint validation in regenc.c.(CVE-2019-16162)

An issue was discovered in Ruby through 2.5.8, 2.6.x through 2.6.6, and 2.7.x through 2.7.1. WEBrick, a simple HTTP server bundled with Ruby, had not checked the transfer-encoding header value rigorously. An attacker may potentially exploit this issue to bypass a reverse proxy (which also has a poor header check), which may lead to an HTTP Request Smuggling attack.(CVE-2020-25613)");
