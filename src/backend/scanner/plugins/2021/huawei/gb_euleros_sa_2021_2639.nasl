A miscalculation of a buffer size was found in openssl's SM2 decryption function, allowing up to 62 arbitrary bytes to be written outside of the buffer. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash an application supporting SM2 signature or encryption algorithm, or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running that application. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.(CVE-2021-3711)

It was found that openssl assumed ASN.1 strings to be NUL terminated. A malicious actor may be able to force an application into calling openssl function with a specially crafted, non-NUL terminated string to deliberately hit this bug, which may result in a crash of the application, causing a Denial of Service attack, or possibly, memory disclosure. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and system availability.(CVE-2021-3712)");
