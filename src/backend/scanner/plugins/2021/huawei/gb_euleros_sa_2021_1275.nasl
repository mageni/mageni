A local attacker could abuse this flaw to crash the QEMU process in sm501_2d_operation() in hw/display/sm501.c on the host, resulting in a denial of service.(CVE-2020-12829)

hw/usb/hcd-ohci.c in QEMU 5.0.0 has a stack-based buffer over-read via values obtained from the host controller driver.(CVE-2020-25624)

A reachable assertion issue was found in the USB EHCI emulation code of QEMU. It could occur while processing USB requests due to missing handling of DMA memory map failure. A malicious privileged user within the guest may abuse this flaw to send bogus USB requests and crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service.(CVE-2020-25723)

hw/usb/hcd-ohci.c in QEMU 5.0.0 has an infinite loop when a TD list has a loop.(CVE-2020-25625)
