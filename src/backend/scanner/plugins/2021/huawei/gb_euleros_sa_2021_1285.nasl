In LibTIFF 4.0.7, a memory leak vulnerability was found in the function OJPEGReadHeaderInfoSecTablesQTable in tif_ojpeg.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted file.(CVE-2017-9404)

LibTIFF 4.0.8 has multiple memory leak vulnerabilities, which allow attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption), as demonstrated by tif_open.c, tif_lzw.c, and tif_aux.c. NOTE: Third parties were unable to reproduce the issue.(CVE-2017-16232)

There is a heap based buffer overflow in tools/tiff2pdf.c of LibTIFF 4.0.8 via a PlanarConfig=Contig image, which causes a more than one hundred bytes out-of-bounds write (related to the ZIPDecode function in tif_zip.c). A crafted input may lead to a remote denial of service attack or an arbitrary code execution attack.(CVE-2017-11335)");
