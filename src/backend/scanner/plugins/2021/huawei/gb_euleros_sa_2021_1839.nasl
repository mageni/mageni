A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to run arbitrary HTML/JS code.(CVE-2020-27783)

An issue was discovered in lxml before 4.2.5. lxml/html/clean.py in the lxml.html.clean module does not remove javascript: URLs that use escaping, allowing a remote attacker to conduct XSS attacks, as demonstrated by 'j a v a s c r i p t:' in Internet Explorer. This is a similar issue to CVE-2014-3146.(CVE-2018-19787)

Incomplete blacklist vulnerability in the lxml.html.clean module in lxml before 3.3.5 allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via control characters in the link scheme to the clean_html function.(CVE-2014-3146)");
