address_space_map in exec.c in QEMU 4.2.0 can trigger a NULL pointer dereference related to BounceBuffer.(CVE-2020-13659)

In QEMU 5.0.0 and earlier, megasas_lookup_frame in hw/scsi/megasas.c has an out-of-bounds read via a crafted reply_queue_head field from a guest OS user.(CVE-2020-13362)

In QEMU 5.0.0 and earlier, es1370_transfer_audio in hw/audio/es1370.c does not properly validate the frame count, which allows guest OS users to trigger an out-of-bounds access during an es1370_write() An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the way that the Windows Kernel handles objects in memory, aka 'Windows Kernel Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability'. This CVE ID is unique from CVE-2020-1411.(CVE-2020-13361)

hw/pci/pci.c in QEMU 4.2.0 allows guest OS users to trigger an out-of-bounds access by providing an address near the end of the PCI configuration space..(CVE-2020-13791)

hw/pci/msix.c in QEMU 4.2.0 allows guest OS users to trigger an out-of-bounds access via a crafted address in an msi-x mmio operation.(CVE-2020-13754)

sd_wp_addr in hw/sd/sd.c in QEMU 4.2.0 uses an unvalidated address, which leads to an out-of-bounds read during sdhci_write() operations. A guest OS user can crash the QEMU process.(CVE-2020-13253)

A potential stack overflow via infinite loop issue was found in various NIC emulators of QEMU in versions up to and including 5.2.0. The issue occurs in loopback mode of a NIC wherein reentrant DMA checks get bypassed. A guest user/process may use this flaw to consume CPU cycles or crash the QEMU process on the host resulting in DoS scenario.(CVE-2021-3416)

hw/net/e1000e_core.c in QEMU 5.0.0 has an infinite loop via an RX descriptor with a NULL buffer address.(CVE-2020-28916)

eth_get_gso_type in net/eth.c in QEMU 4.2.1 allows guest OS users to trigger an assertion failure. A guest can crash the QEMU process via packet data that lacks a valid Layer 3 protocol.(CVE-2020-27617)

hw/usb/hcd-ohci.c in QEMU 5.0.0 has an infinite loop when a TD list has a loop.(CVE-2020-25625)

The patch for CVE-2020-17380/CVE-2020-25085 was found to be ineffective, thus making QEMU vulnerable to the out-of-bounds read/write access issues previously found in the SDHCI controller emulation code. This flaw allows a malicious privileged guest to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service or potential code execution. QEMU up to (including) 5.2.0 is affected by this.(CVE-2021-3409)

QEMU 5.0.0 has a heap-based Buffer Overflow in flatview_read_continue in exec.c because hw/sd/sdhci.c mishandles a write operation in the SDHC_BLKSIZE case.(CVE-2020-25085)

A heap-based buffer overflow was found in QEMU through 5.0.0 in the SDHCI device emulation support. It could occur while doing a multi block SDMA transfer ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
