Schur, and generalized Schur) and related computations (i.e.,
reordering of Schur factorizations and estimating condition numbers)

not general sparse matrices. Similar functionality is provided for
real and complex matrices in both single and double precision. LAPACK
is coded in Fortran90 and built with gcc.");
